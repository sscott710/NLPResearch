Project Description:
Goal of this project: Use machine learning and text classification to idenify themes in historical documents (primarily The Federalist Papers)
Due to my interest in the digital humanities, I wanted to use the tools of computer science to help with the study of history. 
This project explores the use of artificial intelligence in the form of machine learning for identifying themes in historical documents.
The raw data of The Federalist Papers (obtained from Project Gutenberg) was broken up into individual essays.
To ceate the training data, 16 essays were broken up into docuements (sentences or phrases) and manually assigned 1 of 15 themes (I created the list of themes after an extensive literature review of the Federalist Papers).
The docuements from the training data has to be preprocessed and vectorized to be used by the machine learning models.
The machine learning models used in this project were algorithmic classifiers from sklearn, neural networks built from Keras, and ensemble classifiers from sklearn. Oversampling was also explored.
Once the model accuracy is suffieciently high, the goal is to use the models to evalaute the themes in the unlabeled Federalist Papers and perhaps other works from that time.
For more information on this project, please look at the project poster (project_Poster.pdf) found in this folder or contact the author of this file.
Note- this is an abridged verison of the folder. Not everything could be included and uploaded to Github due to file size limits. Please contact the author if you wish to obtain 
the entire and complete REU_2021_Project folder

Operating Instructions:
All of this code for this project was written in Python.
To run any of the code, simply run the Python files in your preferred environment.
To use any of the models, they must be loaded into your Python environment and run. The models could not be included because some of them were too big for Github.
To view or edit any of the data, simply use your preferred text editor.

This work was funded by NSF CCF-1757017 for the Explore Emerging Computing in Science and Engineering (EXERCISE) Reasearch Experience for Undergraduates (REU) at Salisbury University.

File Manifest and Description (all folders and files found within REU_2021_Project):
***a brief description of each file and folder follows the name after the dash (-)
example: fileName - file information***
Code - folder containing all the Python code used in this project
  analyticTool.py - makes or edits csv files to be analyzed by the models (for unlabeled data)
  beginning.py - very first effort of the project; explores preprocessing, tokenization, and finding simple statistics of a text
  hardCodeTheme.py - first attempt at token assignment; very simple rule based approach; ultimately a failure but learned from it
  makeSeparateEssays.py - creates separate text files for each Federalist Paper from the raw Project Gutenberg source
  model1.py - first attempt at a model; mainly used only for addTrainData() and eda() functions
  model2.py - use of pre-existing classification algorithmic models and ensemble classifiers
  model3.py - code for neural network model 1
  model4.py - starting code for neural network model 2; finished under model4n.py
  model4n.py - code for neural network model 2
  model5.py - code for neural network model 3
  model6.py - code for neural network models 4 and 5
  model7.py - code for neural network model 7
  model8.py - a neural network model attempt; does not work and was not explored further in this project
  modelParallel.py - where I would have implemented parallelism; did not have enough time so empty
  playingWithTopicModelling.py - incomplete code; saved and might come back to that strategy of topic modelling later
  topicModRough.py - exploring topic modelling with a single essay
  visualization.py - contains different ways to visualize data (training dataset, results, analytic results, etc)
Raw_Data_Essays - folder containing each individual Federalist Paper essay; I will not describe each file (there's 85) but a simple Google search of the file names will lead you to information about that essay
