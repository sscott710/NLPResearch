none,42  The Powers Conferred by the Constitution Further Considered  From the New York Packet
none,"Tuesday, January 22, 1788"
none,MADISON  To the People of the State of New York
strong federal government,"THE SECOND class of powers, lodged in the general government, consists of those which regulate the intercourse with foreign nations, to wit"
legislative,to make treaties
legislative,"to send and receive ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls"
legislative,"to define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas, and offenses against the law of nations"
legislative,"to regulate foreign commerce, including a power to prohibit, after the year 1808, the importation of slaves, and to lay an intermediate duty of ten dollars per head, as a discouragement to such importations"
strong federal government,This class of powers forms an obvious and essential branch of the federal administration
nationalist outlook,"If we are to be one nation in any respect, it clearly ought to be in respect to other nations"
none,"The powers to make treaties and to send and receive ambassadors, speak their own propriety"
weakness of articles of Confederation,"Both of them are comprised in the articles of Confederation, with this difference only, that the former is disembarrassed, by the plan of the convention, of an exception, under which treaties might be substantially frustrated by regulations of the States"
strong federal government,"and that a power of appointing and receiving ""other public ministers and consuls,"" is expressly and very properly added to the former provision concerning ambassadors"
weakness of articles of Confederation,"The term ambassador, if taken strictly, as seems to be required by the second of the articles of Confederation, comprehends the highest grade only of public ministers, and excludes the grades which the United States will be most likely to prefer, where foreign embassies may be necessary"
none,And under no latitude of construction will the term comprehend consuls
weakness of articles of Confederation,"Yet it has been found expedient, and has been the practice of Congress, to employ the inferior grades of public ministers, and to send and receive consuls"
none,"It is true, that where treaties of commerce stipulate for the mutual appointment of consuls, whose functions are connected with commerce, the admission of foreign consuls may fall within the power of making commercial treaties"
none,"and that where no such treaties exist, the mission of American consuls into foreign countries may PERHAPS be covered under the authority, given by the ninth article of the Confederation, to appoint all such civil officers as may be necessary for managing the general affairs of the United States"
weakness of articles of Confederation,"But the admission of consuls into the United States, where no previous treaty has stipulated it, seems to have been nowhere provided for"
weakness of articles of Confederation,A supply of the omission is one of the lesser instances in which the convention have improved on the model before them
weakness of articles of Confederation,But the most minute provisions become important when they tend to obviate the necessity or the pretext for gradual and unobserved usurpations of power
weakness of articles of Confederation,"A list of the cases in which Congress have been betrayed, or forced by the defects of the Confederation, into violations of their chartered authorities, would not a little surprise those who have paid no attention to the subject"
weakness of articles of Confederation,"and would be no inconsiderable argument in favor of the new Constitution, which seems to have provided no less studiously for the lesser, than the more obvious and striking defects of the old"
strong federal government,"The power to define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas, and offenses against the law of nations, belongs with equal propriety to the general government, and is a still greater improvement on the articles of Confederation"
weakness of articles of Confederation,These articles contain no provision for the case of offenses against the law of nations
weakness of articles of Confederation,and consequently leave it in the power of any indiscreet member to embroil the Confederacy with foreign nations
judicial,The provision of the federal articles on the subject of piracies and felonies extends no further than to the establishment of courts for the trial of these offenses
none,"The definition of piracies might, perhaps, without inconveniency, be left to the law of nations"
strong federal government,though a legislative definition of them is found in most municipal codes
none,A definition of felonies on the high seas is evidently requisite
none,"Felony is a term of loose signification, even in the common law of England"
none,and of various import in the statute law of that kingdom
none,"But neither the common nor the statute law of that, or of any other nation, ought to be a standard for the proceedings of this, unless previously made its own by legislative adoption"
weakness of articles of Confederation,"The meaning of the term, as defined in the codes of the several States, would be as impracticable as the former would be a dishonorable and illegitimate guide"
weakness of articles of Confederation,It is not precisely the same in any two of the States
none,and varies in each with every revision of its criminal laws
federalism,"For the sake of certainty and uniformity, therefore, the power of defining felonies in this case was in every respect necessary and proper"
strong federal government,"The regulation of foreign commerce, having fallen within several views which have been taken of this subject, has been too fully discussed to need additional proofs here of its being properly submitted to the federal administration"
none,"It were doubtless to be wished, that the power of prohibiting the importation of slaves had not been postponed until the year 1808, or rather that it had been suffered to have immediate operation"
none,"But it is not difficult to account, either for this restriction on the general government, or for the manner in which the whole clause is expressed"
natural rights,"It ought to be considered as a great point gained in favor of humanity, that a period of twenty years may terminate forever, within these States, a traffic which has so long and so loudly upbraided the barbarism of modern policy"
federalism,"that within that period, it will receive a considerable discouragement from the federal government, and may be totally abolished, by a concurrence of the few States which continue the unnatural traffic, in the prohibitory example which has been given by so great a majority of the Union"
natural rights,"Happy would it be for the unfortunate Africans, if an equal prospect lay before them of being redeemed from the oppressions of their European brethren"
none,"Attempts have been made to pervert this clause into an objection against the Constitution, by representing it on one side as a criminal toleration of an illicit practice, and on another as calculated to prevent voluntary and beneficial emigrations from Europe to America"
none,"I mention these misconstructions, not with a view to give them an answer, for they deserve none, but as specimens of the manner and spirit in which some have thought fit to conduct their opposition to the proposed government"
union,The powers included in the THIRD class are those which provide for the harmony and proper intercourse among the States
federalism,"Under this head might be included the particular restraints imposed on the authority of the States, and certain powers of the judicial department"
none,"but the former are reserved for a distinct class, and the latter will be particularly examined when we arrive at the structure and organization of the government"
none,"I shall confine myself to a cursory review of the remaining powers comprehended under this third description, to wit"
legislative,to regulate commerce among the several States and the Indian tribes
legislative,"to coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin"
legislative,to provide for the punishment of counterfeiting the current coin and securities of the United States
legislative,to fix the standard of weights and measures
legislative,"to establish a uniform rule of naturalization, and uniform laws of bankruptcy, to prescribe the manner in which the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of each State shall be proved, and the effect they shall have in other States"
legislative,and to establish post offices and post roads
weakness of articles of Confederation,"The defect of power in the existing Confederacy to regulate the commerce between its several members, is in the number of those which have been clearly pointed out by experience"
none,"To the proofs and remarks which former papers have brought into view on this subject, it may be added that without this supplemental provision, the great and essential power of regulating foreign commerce would have been incomplete and ineffectual"
federalism,"A very material object of this power was the relief of the States which import and export through other States, from the improper contributions levied on them by the latter"
weakness of articles of Confederation,"Were these at liberty to regulate the trade between State and State, it must be foreseen that ways would be found out to load the articles of import and export, during the passage through their jurisdiction, with duties which would fall on the makers of the latter and the consumers of the former"
weakness of articles of Confederation,"We may be assured by past experience, that such a practice would be introduced by future contrivances"
human nature,"and both by that and a common knowledge of human affairs, that it would nourish unceasing animosities, and not improbably terminate in serious interruptions of the public tranquillity"
none,"To those who do not view the question through the medium of passion or of interest, the desire of the commercial States to collect, in any form, an indirect revenue from their uncommercial neighbors, must appear not less impolitic than it is unfair"
none,"since it would stimulate the injured party, by resentment as well as interest, to resort to less convenient channels for their foreign trade"
interest-group theory,"But the mild voice of reason, pleading the cause of an enlarged and permanent interest, is but too often drowned, before public bodies as well as individuals, by the clamors of an impatient avidity for immediate and immoderate gain"
strong federal government,"The necessity of a superintending authority over the reciprocal trade of confederated States, has been illustrated by other examples as well as our own"
none,"In Switzerland, where the Union is so very slight, each canton is obliged to allow to merchandises a passage through its jurisdiction into other cantons, without an augmentation of the tolls"
none,"In Germany it is a law of the empire, that the princes and states shall not lay tolls or customs on bridges, rivers, or passages, without the consent of the emperor and the diet"
weakness of articles of Confederation,"though it appears from a quotation in an antecedent paper, that the practice in this, as in many other instances in that confederacy, has not followed the law, and has produced there the mischiefs which have been foreseen here"
none,"Among the restraints imposed by the Union of the Netherlands on its members, one is, that they shall not establish imposts disadvantageous to their neighbors, without the general permission"
weakness of articles of Confederation,"The regulation of commerce with the Indian tribes is very properly unfettered from two limitations in the articles of Confederation, which render the provision obscure and contradictory"
none,"The power is there restrained to Indians, not members of any of the States, and is not to violate or infringe the legislative right of any State within its own limits"
weakness of articles of Confederation,"What description of Indians are to be deemed members of a State, is not yet settled, and has been a question of frequent perplexity and contention in the federal councils"
weakness of articles of Confederation,"And how the trade with Indians, though not members of a State, yet residing within its legislative jurisdiction, can be regulated by an external authority, without so far intruding on the internal rights of legislation, is absolutely incomprehensible"
weakness of articles of Confederation,This is not the only case in which the articles of Confederation have inconsiderately endeavored to accomplish impossibilities
weakness of articles of Confederation,"to reconcile a partial sovereignty in the Union, with complete sovereignty in the States"
weakness of articles of Confederation,"to subvert a mathematical axiom, by taking away a part, and letting the whole remain"
weakness of articles of Confederation,"All that need be remarked on the power to coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin, is, that by providing for this last case, the Constitution has supplied a material omission in the articles of Confederation"
weakness of articles of Confederation,"The authority of the existing Congress is restrained to the regulation of coin STRUCK by their own authority, or that of the respective States"
weakness of articles of Confederation,It must be seen at once that the proposed uniformity in the VALUE of the current coin might be destroyed by subjecting that of foreign coin to the different regulations of the different States
none,"The punishment of counterfeiting the public securities, as well as the current coin, is submitted of course to that authority which is to secure the value of both"
legislative,"The regulation of weights and measures is transferred from the articles of Confederation, and is founded on like considerations with the preceding power of regulating coin"
weakness of articles of Confederation,"The dissimilarity in the rules of naturalization has long been remarked as a fault in our system, and as laying a foundation for intricate and delicate questions"
none,"In the fourth article of the Confederation, it is declared ""that the FREE INHABITANTS of each of these States, paupers, vagabonds, and fugitives from justice, excepted, shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of FREE CITIZENS in the several States"
none,"and THE PEOPLE of each State shall, in every other, enjoy all the privileges of trade and commerce,"" etc"
weakness of articles of Confederation,"There is a confusion of language here, which is remarkable"
weakness of articles of Confederation,"Why the terms FREE INHABITANTS are used in one part of the article, FREE CITIZENS in another, and PEOPLE in another"
weakness of articles of Confederation,"or what was meant by superadding to ""all privileges and immunities of free citizens,"" ""all the privileges of trade and commerce,"" cannot easily be determined"
none,"It seems to be a construction scarcely avoidable, however, that those who come under the denomination of FREE INHABITANTS of a State, although not citizens of such State, are entitled, in every other State, to all the privileges of FREE CITIZENS of the latter"
none,"that is, to greater privileges than they may be entitled to in their own State"
none,"so that it may be in the power of a particular State, or rather every State is laid under a necessity, not only to confer the rights of citizenship in other States upon any whom it may admit to such rights within itself, but upon any whom it may allow to become inhabitants within its jurisdiction"
none,"But were an exposition of the term ""inhabitants"" to be admitted which would confine the stipulated privileges to citizens alone, the difficulty is diminished only, not removed"
none,"The very improper power would still be retained by each State, of naturalizing aliens in every other State"
none,"In one State, residence for a short term confirms all the rights of citizenship"
none,"in another, qualifications of greater importance are required"
none,"An alien, therefore, legally incapacitated for certain rights in the latter, may, by previous residence only in the former, elude his incapacity"
none,"and thus the law of one State be preposterously rendered paramount to the law of another, within the jurisdiction of the other"
weakness of articles of Confederation,"We owe it to mere casualty, that very serious embarrassments on this subject have been hitherto escaped"
none,"By the laws of several States, certain descriptions of aliens, who had rendered themselves obnoxious, were laid under interdicts inconsistent not only with the rights of citizenship but with the privilege of residence"
none,"What would have been the consequence, if such persons, by residence or otherwise, had acquired the character of citizens under the laws of another State, and then asserted their rights as such, both to residence and citizenship, within the State proscribing them"
none,"Whatever the legal consequences might have been, other consequences would probably have resulted, of too serious a nature not to be provided against"
strong federal government,"The new Constitution has accordingly, with great propriety, made provision against them, and all others proceeding from the defect of the Confederation on this head, by authorizing the general government to establish a uniform rule of naturalization throughout the United States"
legislative,"The power of establishing uniform laws of bankruptcy is so intimately connected with the regulation of commerce, and will prevent so many frauds where the parties or their property may lie or be removed into different States, that the expediency of it seems not likely to be drawn into question"
federalism,"The power of prescribing by general laws, the manner in which the public acts, records and judicial proceedings of each State shall be proved, and the effect they shall have in other States, is an evident and valuable improvement on the clause relating to this subject in the articles of Confederation"
none,"The meaning of the latter is extremely indeterminate, and can be of little importance under any interpretation which it will bear"
none,"The power here established may be rendered a very convenient instrument of justice, and be particularly beneficial on the borders of contiguous States, where the effects liable to justice may be suddenly and secretly translated, in any stage of the process, within a foreign jurisdiction"
legislative,"The power of establishing post roads must, in every view, be a harmless power, and may, perhaps, by judicious management, become productive of great public conveniency"
union,Nothing which tends to facilitate the intercourse between the States can be deemed unworthy of the public care

legislative,"HAVING examined the constitution of the House of Representatives, and answered such of the objections against it as seemed to merit notice, I enter next on the examination of the Senate"
none,The heads into which this member of the government may be considered are
none,I
legislative,The qualification of senators
none,II
federalism,The appointment of them by the State legislatures
none,III
legislative,The equality of representation in the Senate
none,IV
legislative,"The number of senators, and the term for which they are to be elected"
none,V
legislative,The powers vested in the Senate
none,I
legislative,"The qualifications proposed for senators, as distinguished from those of representatives, consist in a more advanced age and a longer period of citizenship"
legislative,A senator must be thirty years of age at least
legislative,as a representative must be twenty-five
legislative,And the former must have been a citizen nine years
legislative,as seven years are required for the latter
human nature,"The propriety of these distinctions is explained by the nature of the senatorial trust, which, requiring greater extent of information and stability of character, requires at the same time that the senator should have reached a period of life most likely to supply these advantages"
none,"and which, participating immediately in transactions with foreign nations, ought to be exercised by none who are not thoroughly weaned from the prepossessions and habits incident to foreign birth and education"
none,"The term of nine years appears to be a prudent mediocrity between a total exclusion of adopted citizens, whose merits and talents may claim a share in the public confidence, and an indiscriminate and hasty admission of them, which might create a channel for foreign influence on the national councils"
none,II
federalism,It is equally unnecessary to dilate on the appointment of senators by the State legislatures
none,"Among the various modes which might have been devised for constituting this branch of the government, that which has been proposed by the convention is probably the most congenial with the public opinion"
federalism,"It is recommended by the double advantage of favoring a select appointment, and of giving to the State governments such an agency in the formation of the federal government as must secure the authority of the former, and may form a convenient link between the two systems"
none,III
legislative,"The equality of representation in the Senate is another point, which, being evidently the result of compromise between the opposite pretensions of the large and the small States, does not call for much discussion"
nationalist outlook,"If indeed it be right, that among a people thoroughly incorporated into one nation, every district ought to have a PROPORTIONAL share in the government, and that among independent and sovereign States, bound together by a simple league, the parties, however unequal in size, ought to have an EQUAL share in the common councils, it does not appear to be without some reason that in a compound republic, partaking both of the national and federal character, the government ought to be founded on a mixture of the principles of proportional and equal representation"
none,"But it is superfluous to try, by the standard of theory, a part of the Constitution which is allowed on all hands to be the result, not of theory, but ""of a spirit of amity, and that mutual deference and concession which the peculiarity of our political situation rendered indispensable"
republican principles,""" A common government, with powers equal to its objects, is called for by the voice, and still more loudly by the political situation, of America"
none,"A government founded on principles more consonant to the wishes of the larger States, is not likely to be obtained from the smaller States"
none,"The only option, then, for the former, lies between the proposed government and a government still more objectionable"
none,"Under this alternative, the advice of prudence must be to embrace the lesser evil"
none,"and, instead of indulging a fruitless anticipation of the possible mischiefs which may ensue, to contemplate rather the advantageous consequences which may qualify the sacrifice"
federalism,"In this spirit it may be remarked, that the equal vote allowed to each State is at once a constitutional recognition of the portion of sovereignty remaining in the individual States, and an instrument for preserving that residuary sovereignty"
none,So far the equality ought to be no less acceptable to the large than to the small States
none,"since they are not less solicitous to guard, by every possible expedient, against an improper consolidation of the States into one simple republic"
checks and balances,"Another advantage accruing from this ingredient in the constitution of the Senate is, the additional impediment it must prove against improper acts of legislation"
checks and balances,"No law or resolution can now be passed without the concurrence, first, of a majority of the people, and then, of a majority of the States"
checks and balances,It must be acknowledged that this complicated check on legislation may in some instances be injurious as well as beneficial
none,"and that the peculiar defense which it involves in favor of the smaller States, would be more rational, if any interests common to them, and distinct from those of the other States, would otherwise be exposed to peculiar danger"
checks and balances,"But as the larger States will always be able, by their power over the supplies, to defeat unreasonable exertions of this prerogative of the lesser States, and as the faculty and excess of law-making seem to be the diseases to which our governments are most liable, it is not impossible that this part of the Constitution may be more convenient in practice than it appears to many in contemplation"
none,IV
legislative,"The number of senators, and the duration of their appointment, come next to be considered"
none,"In order to form an accurate judgment on both of these points, it will be proper to inquire into the purposes which are to be answered by a senate"
none,"and in order to ascertain these, it will be necessary to review the inconveniences which a republic must suffer from the want of such an institution"
none,First
republican principles,"It is a misfortune incident to republican government, though in a less degree than to other governments, that those who administer it may forget their obligations to their constituents, and prove unfaithful to their important trust"
checks and balances,"In this point of view, a senate, as a second branch of the legislative assembly, distinct from, and dividing the power with, a first, must be in all cases a salutary check on the government"
checks and balances,"It doubles the security to the people, by requiring the concurrence of two distinct bodies in schemes of usurpation or perfidy, where the ambition or corruption of one would otherwise be sufficient"
none,"This is a precaution founded on such clear principles, and now so well understood in the United States, that it would be more than superfluous to enlarge on it"
republican principles,"I will barely remark, that as the improbability of sinister combinations will be in proportion to the dissimilarity in the genius of the two bodies, it must be politic to distinguish them from each other by every circumstance which will consist with a due harmony in all proper measures, and with the genuine principles of republican government"
none,Second
interest-group theory,"The necessity of a senate is not less indicated by the propensity of all single and numerous assemblies to yield to the impulse of sudden and violent passions, and to be seduced by factious leaders into intemperate and pernicious resolutions"
none,Examples on this subject might be cited without number
none,"and from proceedings within the United States, as well as from the history of other nations"
none,"But a position that will not be contradicted, need not be proved"
none,"All that need be remarked is, that a body which is to correct this infirmity ought itself to be free from it, and consequently ought to be less numerous"
legislative,"It ought, moreover, to possess great firmness, and consequently ought to hold its authority by a tenure of considerable duration"
none,Third
legislative,Another defect to be supplied by a senate lies in a want of due acquaintance with the objects and principles of legislation
human nature,"It is not possible that an assembly of men called for the most part from pursuits of a private nature, continued in appointment for a short time, and led by no permanent motive to devote the intervals of public occupation to a study of the laws, the affairs, and the comprehensive interests of their country, should, if left wholly to themselves, escape a variety of important errors in the exercise of their legislative trust"
weakness of articles of Confederation,"It may be affirmed, on the best grounds, that no small share of the present embarrassments of America is to be charged on the blunders of our governments"
none,and that these have proceeded from the heads rather than the hearts of most of the authors of them
none,"What indeed are all the repealing, explaining, and amending laws, which fill and disgrace our voluminous codes, but so many monuments of deficient wisdom"
none,so many impeachments exhibited by each succeeding against each preceding session
none,"so many admonitions to the people, of the value of those aids which may be expected from a well-constituted senate"
none,A good government implies two things
republican principles,"first, fidelity to the object of government, which is the happiness of the people"
republican principles,"secondly, a knowledge of the means by which that object can be best attained"
none,Some governments are deficient in both these qualities
none,most governments are deficient in the first
weakness of articles of Confederation,"I scruple not to assert, that in American governments too little attention has been paid to the last"
none,The federal Constitution avoids this error
checks and balances,"and what merits particular notice, it provides for the last in a mode which increases the security for the first"
none,Fourth
legislative,"The mutability in the public councils arising from a rapid succession of new members, however qualified they may be, points out, in the strongest manner, the necessity of some stable institution in the government"
legislative,Every new election in the States is found to change one half of the representatives
none,From this change of men must proceed a change of opinions
none,"and from a change of opinions, a change of measures"
legislative,But a continual change even of good measures is inconsistent with every rule of prudence and every prospect of success
none,"The remark is verified in private life, and becomes more just, as well as more important, in national transactions"
none,To trace the mischievous effects of a mutable government would fill a volume
none,"I will hint a few only, each of which will be perceived to be a source of innumerable others"
nationalist outlook,"In the first place, it forfeits the respect and confidence of other nations, and all the advantages connected with national character"
none,"An individual who is observed to be inconstant to his plans, or perhaps to carry on his affairs without any plan at all, is marked at once, by all prudent people, as a speedy victim to his own unsteadiness and folly"
none,"His more friendly neighbors may pity him, but all will decline to connect their fortunes with his"
none,and not a few will seize the opportunity of making their fortunes out of his
nationalist outlook,One nation is to another what one individual is to another
none,"with this melancholy distinction perhaps, that the former, with fewer of the benevolent emotions than the latter, are under fewer restraints also from taking undue advantage from the indiscretions of each other"
nationalist outlook,"Every nation, consequently, whose affairs betray a want of wisdom and stability, may calculate on every loss which can be sustained from the more systematic policy of their wiser neighbors"
weakness of articles of Confederation,But the best instruction on this subject is unhappily conveyed to America by the example of her own situation
none,She finds that she is held in no respect by her friends
none,that she is the derision of her enemies
none,and that she is a prey to every nation which has an interest in speculating on her fluctuating councils and embarrassed affairs
union,The internal effects of a mutable policy are still more calamitous
natural rights,It poisons the blessing of liberty itself
republican principles,"It will be of little avail to the people, that the laws are made by men of their own choice, if the laws be so voluminous that they cannot be read, or so incoherent that they cannot be understood"
none,"if they be repealed or revised before they are promulgated, or undergo such incessant changes that no man, who knows what the law is to-day, can guess what it will be to-morrow"
none,Law is defined to be a rule of action
none,"but how can that be a rule, which is little known, and less fixed"
interest-group theory,"Another effect of public instability is the unreasonable advantage it gives to the sagacious, the enterprising, and the moneyed few over the industrious and uninformed mass of the people"
interest-group theory,"Every new regulation concerning commerce or revenue, or in any way affecting the value of the different species of property, presents a new harvest to those who watch the change, and can trace its consequences"
nationalist outlook,"a harvest, reared not by themselves, but by the toils and cares of the great body of their fellow-citizens"
interest-group theory,"This is a state of things in which it may be said with some truth that laws are made for the FEW, not for the MANY"
none,"In another point of view, great injury results from an unstable government"
none,"The want of confidence in the public councils damps every useful undertaking, the success and profit of which may depend on a continuance of existing arrangements"
none,What prudent merchant will hazard his fortunes in any new branch of commerce when he knows not but that his plans may be rendered unlawful before they can be executed
none,"What farmer or manufacturer will lay himself out for the encouragement given to any particular cultivation or establishment, when he can have no assurance that his preparatory labors and advances will not render him a victim to an inconstant government"
strong federal government,"In a word, no great improvement or laudable enterprise can go forward which requires the auspices of a steady system of national policy"
none,"But the most deplorable effect of all is that diminution of attachment and reverence which steals into the hearts of the people, towards a political system which betrays so many marks of infirmity, and disappoints so many of their flattering hopes"
none,"No government, any more than an individual, will long be respected without being truly respectable"
strong federal government,"nor be truly respectable, without possessing a certain portion of order and stability"

executive,"THERE is an idea, which is not without its advocates, that a vigorous Executive is inconsistent with the genius of republican government"
none,The enlightened well-wishers to this species of government must at least hope that the supposition is destitute of foundation
none,"since they can never admit its truth, without at the same time admitting the condemnation of their own principles"
executive,Energy in the Executive is a leading character in the definition of good government
executive,It is essential to the protection of the community against foreign attacks
executive,it is not less essential to the steady administration of the laws
interest-group theory,to the protection of property against those irregular and high-handed combinations which sometimes interrupt the ordinary course of justice
interest-group theory,"to the security of liberty against the enterprises and assaults of ambition, of faction, and of anarchy"
strong federal government,"Every man the least conversant in Roman history, knows how often that republic was obliged to take refuge in the absolute power of a single man, under the formidable title of Dictator, as well against the intrigues of ambitious individuals who aspired to the tyranny, and the seditions of whole classes of the community whose conduct threatened the existence of all government, as against the invasions of external enemies who menaced the conquest and destruction of Rome"
none,"There can be no need, however, to multiply arguments or examples on this head"
none,A feeble Executive implies a feeble execution of the government
none,A feeble execution is but another phrase for a bad execution
none,"and a government ill executed, whatever it may be in theory, must be, in practice, a bad government"
executive,"Taking it for granted, therefore, that all men of sense will agree in the necessity of an energetic Executive, it will only remain to inquire, what are the ingredients which constitute this energy"
republican principles,How far can they be combined with those other ingredients which constitute safety in the republican sense
none,And how far does this combination characterize the plan which has been reported by the convention
executive,"The ingredients which constitute energy in the Executive are, first, unity"
executive,"secondly, duration"
executive,"thirdly, an adequate provision for its support"
executive,"fourthly, competent powers"
republican principles,"The ingredients which constitute safety in the republican sense are, first, a due dependence on the people, secondly, a due responsibility"
none,"Those politicians and statesmen who have been the most celebrated for the soundness of their principles and for the justice of their views, have declared in favor of a single Executive and a numerous legislature"
separation of powers,"They have with great propriety, considered energy as the most necessary qualification of the former, and have regarded this as most applicable to power in a single hand, while they have, with equal propriety, considered the latter as best adapted to deliberation and wisdom, and best calculated to conciliate the confidence of the people and to secure their privileges and interests"
none,That unity is conducive to energy will not be disputed
executive,"Decision, activity, secrecy, and despatch will generally characterize the proceedings of one man in a much more eminent degree than the proceedings of any greater number"
none,"and in proportion as the number is increased, these qualities will be diminished"
none,This unity may be destroyed in two ways
none,either by vesting the power in two or more magistrates of equal dignity and authority
none,"or by vesting it ostensibly in one man, subject, in whole or in part, to the control and co-operation of others, in the capacity of counsellors to him"
none,"Of the first, the two Consuls of Rome may serve as an example"
none,"of the last, we shall find examples in the constitutions of several of the States"
none,"New York and New Jersey, if I recollect right, are the only States which have intrusted the executive authority wholly to single men"
none,(1) Both these methods of destroying the unity of the Executive have their partisans
none,but the votaries of an executive council are the most numerous
none,"They are both liable, if not to equal, to similar objections, and may in most lights be examined in conjunction"

executive,"As far, however, as it teaches any thing, it teaches us not to be enamoured of plurality in the Executive"
none,"We have seen that the Achaeans, on an experiment of two Praetors, were induced to abolish one"
none,"The Roman history records many instances of mischiefs to the republic from the dissensions between the Consuls, and between the military Tribunes, who were at times substituted for the Consuls"
none,But it gives us no specimens of any peculiar advantages derived to the state from the circumstance of the plurality of those magistrates
none,"That the dissensions between them were not more frequent or more fatal, is a matter of astonishment, until we advert to the singular position in which the republic was almost continually placed, and to the prudent policy pointed out by the circumstances of the state, and pursued by the Consuls, of making a division of the government between them"
interest-group theory,The patricians engaged in a perpetual struggle with the plebeians for the preservation of their ancient authorities and dignities
none,"the Consuls, who were generally chosen out of the former body, were commonly united by the personal interest they had in the defense of the privileges of their order"
none,"In addition to this motive of union, after the arms of the republic had considerably expanded the bounds of its empire, it became an established custom with the Consuls to divide the administration between themselves by lot--one of them remaining at Rome to govern the city and its environs, the other taking the command in the more distant provinces"
interest-group theory,"This expedient must, no doubt, have had great influence in preventing those collisions and rivalships which might otherwise have embroiled the peace of the republic"
executive,"But quitting the dim light of historical research, attaching ourselves purely to the dictates of reason and good sense, we shall discover much greater cause to reject than to approve the idea of plurality in the Executive, under any modification whatever"
none,"Wherever two or more persons are engaged in any common enterprise or pursuit, there is always danger of difference of opinion"
none,"If it be a public trust or office, in which they are clothed with equal dignity and authority, there is peculiar danger of personal emulation and even animosity"
none,"From either, and especially from all these causes, the most bitter dissensions are apt to spring"
none,"Whenever these happen, they lessen the respectability, weaken the authority, and distract the plans and operation of those whom they divide"
none,"If they should unfortunately assail the supreme executive magistracy of a country, consisting of a plurality of persons, they might impede or frustrate the most important measures of the government, in the most critical emergencies of the state"
interest-group theory,"And what is still worse, they might split the community into the most violent and irreconcilable factions, adhering differently to the different individuals who composed the magistracy"
none,"Men often oppose a thing, merely because they have had no agency in planning it, or because it may have been planned by those whom they dislike"
none,"But if they have been consulted, and have happened to disapprove, opposition then becomes, in their estimation, an indispensable duty of self-love"
none,"They seem to think themselves bound in honor, and by all the motives of personal infallibility, to defeat the success of what has been resolved upon contrary to their sentiments"
interest-group theory,"Men of upright, benevolent tempers have too many opportunities of remarking, with horror, to what desperate lengths this disposition is sometimes carried, and how often the great interests of society are sacrificed to the vanity, to the conceit, and to the obstinacy of individuals, who have credit enough to make their passions and their caprices interesting to mankind"
human nature,"Perhaps the question now before the public may, in its consequences, afford melancholy proofs of the effects of this despicable frailty, or rather detestable vice, in the human character"
legislative,"Upon the principles of a free government, inconveniences from the source just mentioned must necessarily be submitted to in the formation of the legislature"
executive,"but it is unnecessary, and therefore unwise, to introduce them into the constitution of the Executive"
none,It is here too that they may be most pernicious
legislative,"In the legislature, promptitude of decision is oftener an evil than a benefit"
interest-group theory,"The differences of opinion, and the jarrings of parties in that department of the government, though they may sometimes obstruct salutary plans, yet often promote deliberation and circumspection, and serve to check excesses in the majority"
none,"When a resolution too is once taken, the opposition must be at an end"
none,"That resolution is a law, and resistance to it punishable"
executive,But no favorable circumstances palliate or atone for the disadvantages of dissension in the executive department
none,"Here, they are pure and unmixed"
none,There is no point at which they cease to operate
none,"They serve to embarrass and weaken the execution of the plan or measure to which they relate, from the first step to the final conclusion of it"
executive,"They constantly counteract those qualities in the Executive which are the most necessary ingredients in its composition--vigor and expedition, and this without any counterbalancing good"
executive,"In the conduct of war, in which the energy of the Executive is the bulwark of the national security, every thing would be to be apprehended from its plurality"
none,"It must be confessed that these observations apply with principal weight to the first case supposed--that is, to a plurality of magistrates of equal dignity and authority a scheme, the advocates for which are not likely to form a numerous sect"
executive,"but they apply, though not with equal, yet with considerable weight to the project of a council, whose concurrence is made constitutionally necessary to the operations of the ostensible Executive"
none,An artful cabal in that council would be able to distract and to enervate the whole system of administration
executive,"If no such cabal should exist, the mere diversity of views and opinions would alone be sufficient to tincture the exercise of the executive authority with a spirit of habitual feebleness and dilatoriness"
executive,"(But one of the weightiest objections to a plurality in the Executive, and which lies as much against the last as the first plan, is, that it tends to conceal faults and destroy responsibility"
none,Responsibility is of two kinds--to censure and to punishment
none,"The first is the more important of the two, especially in an elective office"
none,"Man, in public trust, will much oftener act in such a manner as to render him unworthy of being any longer trusted, than in such a manner as to make him obnoxious to legal punishment"
none,But the multiplication of the Executive adds to the difficulty of detection in either case
none,"It often becomes impossible, amidst mutual accusations, to determine on whom the blame or the punishment of a pernicious measure, or series of pernicious measures, ought really to fall"
none,"It is shifted from one to another with so much dexterity, and under such plausible appearances, that the public opinion is left in suspense about the real author"
none,"The circumstances which may have led to any national miscarriage or misfortune are sometimes so complicated that, where there are a number of actors who may have had different degrees and kinds of agency, though we may clearly see upon the whole that there has been mismanagement, yet it may be impracticable to pronounce to whose account the evil which may have been incurred is truly chargeable"
none,""I was overruled by my council"
none,The council were so divided in their opinions that it was impossible to obtain any better resolution on the point

none,"Should there be found a citizen zealous enough to undertake the unpromising task, if there happen to be collusion between the parties concerned, how easy it is to clothe the circumstances with so much ambiguity, as to render it uncertain what was the precise conduct of any of those parties"
none,"In the single instance in which the governor of this State is coupled with a council--that is, in the appointment to offices, we have seen the mischiefs of it in the view now under consideration"
none,Scandalous appointments to important offices have been made
none,"Some cases, indeed, have been so flagrant that ALL PARTIES have agreed in the impropriety of the thing"
none,"When inquiry has been made, the blame has been laid by the governor on the members of the council, who, on their part, have charged it upon his nomination"
none,"while the people remain altogether at a loss to determine, by whose influence their interests have been committed to hands so unqualified and so manifestly improper"
none,"In tenderness to individuals, I forbear to descend to particulars"
republican principles,"It is evident from these considerations, that the plurality of the Executive tends to deprive the people of the two greatest securities they can have for the faithful exercise of any delegated power, first, the restraints of public opinion, which lose their efficacy, as well on account of the division of the censure attendant on bad measures among a number, as on account of the uncertainty on whom it ought to fall"
republican principles,"and, second, the opportunity of discovering with facility and clearness the misconduct of the persons they trust, in order either to their removal from office or to their actual punishment in cases which admit of it"
none,"In England, the king is a perpetual magistrate"
none,"and it is a maxim which has obtained for the sake of the public peace, that he is unaccountable for his administration, and his person sacred"
none,"Nothing, therefore, can be wiser in that kingdom, than to annex to the king a constitutional council, who may be responsible to the nation for the advice they give"
none,"Without this, there would be no responsibility whatever in the executive department an idea inadmissible in a free government"
none,"But even there the king is not bound by the resolutions of his council, though they are answerable for the advice they give"
none,"He is the absolute master of his own conduct in the exercise of his office, and may observe or disregard the counsel given to him at his sole discretion"
republican principles,"But in a republic, where every magistrate ought to be personally responsible for his behavior in office the reason which in the British Constitution dictates the propriety of a council, not only ceases to apply, but turns against the institution"
none,"In the monarchy of Great Britain, it furnishes a substitute for the prohibited responsibility of the chief magistrate, which serves in some degree as a hostage to the national justice for his good behavior"
executive,"In the American republic, it would serve to destroy, or would greatly diminish, the intended and necessary responsibility of the Chief Magistrate himself"
none,"The idea of a council to the Executive, which has so generally obtained in the State constitutions, has been derived from that maxim of republican jealousy which considers power as safer in the hands of a number of men than of a single man"
none,"If the maxim should be admitted to be applicable to the case, I should contend that the advantage on that side would not counterbalance the numerous disadvantages on the opposite side"
executive,But I do not think the rule at all applicable to the executive power
executive,"I clearly concur in opinion, in this particular, with a writer whom the celebrated Junius pronounces to be ""deep, solid, and ingenious,"" that ""the executive power is more easily confined when it is ONE"""
republican principles,(2) that it is far more safe there should be a single object for the jealousy and watchfulness of the people
executive,"and, in a word, that all multiplication of the Executive is rather dangerous than friendly to liberty"
executive,"A little consideration will satisfy us, that the species of security sought for in the multiplication of the Executive, is unattainable"
none,"Numbers must be so great as to render combination difficult, or they are rather a source of danger than of security"
natural rights,"The united credit and influence of several individuals must be more formidable to liberty, than the credit and influence of either of them separately"
none,"When power, therefore, is placed in the hands of so small a number of men, as to admit of their interests and views being easily combined in a common enterprise, by an artful leader, it becomes more liable to abuse, and more dangerous when abused, than if it be lodged in the hands of one man"
separation of powers,"who, from the very circumstance of his being alone, will be more narrowly watched and more readily suspected, and who cannot unite so great a mass of influence as when he is associated with others"
none,"The Decemvirs of Rome, whose name denotes their number,(3) were more to be dreaded in their usurpation than any ONE of them would have been"
none,No person would think of proposing an Executive much more numerous than that body
none,from six to a dozen have been suggested for the number of the council
none,"The extreme of these numbers, is not too great for an easy combination"
none,"and from such a combination America would have more to fear, than from the ambition of any single individual"
none,"A council to a magistrate, who is himself responsible for what he does, are generally nothing better than a clog upon his good intentions, are often the instruments and accomplices of his bad and are almost always a cloak to his faults"
none,I forbear to dwell upon the subject of expense
none,"though it be evident that if the council should be numerous enough to answer the principal end aimed at by the institution, the salaries of the members, who must be drawn from their homes to reside at the seat of government, would form an item in the catalogue of public expenditures too serious to be incurred for an object of equivocal utility"
union,"I will only add that, prior to the appearance of the Constitution, I rarely met with an intelligent man from any of the States, who did not admit, as the result of experience, that the UNITY of the executive of this State was one of the best of the distinguishing features of our constitution"

strong federal government,"unless the contrary of this position can be fairly and rationally disputed, it must be admitted, as a necessary consequence, that there can be no limitation of that authority which is to provide for the defense and protection of the community, in any matter essential to its efficacy that is, in any matter essential to the FORMATION, DIRECTION, or SUPPORT of the NATIONAL FORCES"

judicial,"The judiciary, on the contrary, has no influence over either the sword or the purse"
judicial,no direction either of the strength or of the wealth of the society
none,and can take no active resolution whatever
judicial,"It may truly be said to have neither FORCE nor WILL, but merely judgment"
checks and balances,and must ultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of its judgments
none,This simple view of the matter suggests several important consequences
separation of powers,"It proves incontestably, that the judiciary is beyond comparison the weakest of the three departments of power(1)"
none,that it can never attack with success either of the other two
none,and that all possible care is requisite to enable it to defend itself against their attacks
natural rights,"It equally proves, that though individual oppression may now and then proceed from the courts of justice, the general liberty of the people can never be endangered from that quarter"
separation of powers,I mean so long as the judiciary remains truly distinct from both the legislature and the Executive
separation of powers,"For I agree, that ""there is no liberty, if the power of judging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers"
separation of powers,"""(2) And it proves, in the last place, that as liberty can have nothing to fear from the judiciary alone, but would have every thing to fear from its union with either of the other departments"
separation of powers,"that as all the effects of such a union must ensue from a dependence of the former on the latter, notwithstanding a nominal and apparent separation"
separation of powers,"that as, from the natural feebleness of the judiciary, it is in continual jeopardy of being overpowered, awed, or influenced by its co-ordinate branches"
judicial,"and that as nothing can contribute so much to its firmness and independence as permanency in office, this quality may therefore be justly regarded as an indispensable ingredient in its constitution, and, in a great measure, as the citadel of the public justice and the public security"
judicial,The complete independence of the courts of justice is peculiarly essential in a limited Constitution
legislative,"By a limited Constitution, I understand one which contains certain specified exceptions to the legislative authority"
legislative,"such, for instance, as that it shall pass no bills of attainder, no ex post facto laws, and the like"
checks and balances,"Limitations of this kind can be preserved in practice no other way than through the medium of courts of justice, whose duty it must be to declare all acts contrary to the manifest tenor of the Constitution void"
natural rights,"Without this, all the reservations of particular rights or privileges would amount to nothing"
judicial,"Some perplexity respecting the rights of the courts to pronounce legislative acts void, because contrary to the Constitution, has arisen from an imagination that the doctrine would imply a superiority of the judiciary to the legislative power"
checks and balances,"It is urged that the authority which can declare the acts of another void, must necessarily be superior to the one whose acts may be declared void"
none,"As this doctrine is of great importance in all the American constitutions, a brief discussion of the ground on which it rests cannot be unacceptable"
none,"There is no position which depends on clearer principles, than that every act of a delegated authority, contrary to the tenor of the commission under which it is exercised, is void"
legislative,"No legislative act, therefore, contrary to the Constitution, can be valid"
none,"To deny this, would be to affirm, that the deputy is greater than his principal"
none,that the servant is above his master
republican principles,that the representatives of the people are superior to the people themselves
human nature,"that men acting by virtue of powers, may do not only what their powers do not authorize, but what they forbid"
separation of powers,"If it be said that the legislative body are themselves the constitutional judges of their own powers, and that the construction they put upon them is conclusive upon the other departments, it may be answered, that this cannot be the natural presumption, where it is not to be collected from any particular provisions in the Constitution"
republican principles,"It is not otherwise to be supposed, that the Constitution could intend to enable the representatives of the people to substitute their will to that of their constituents"
checks and balances,"It is far more rational to suppose, that the courts were designed to be an intermediate body between the people and the legislature, in order, among other things, to keep the latter within the limits assigned to their authority"
judicial,The interpretation of the laws is the proper and peculiar province of the courts
judicial,"A constitution is, in fact, and must be regarded by the judges, as a fundamental law"
judicial,"It therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning, as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body"
checks and balances,"If there should happen to be an irreconcilable variance between the two, that which has the superior obligation and validity ought, of course, to be preferred"
republican principles,"or, in other words, the Constitution ought to be preferred to the statute, the intention of the people to the intention of their agents"
separation of powers,Nor does this conclusion by any means suppose a superiority of the judicial to the legislative power
republican principles,It only supposes that the power of the people is superior to both
checks and balances,"and that where the will of the legislature, declared in its statutes, stands in opposition to that of the people, declared in the Constitution, the judges ought to be governed by the latter rather than the former"
judicial,"They ought to regulate their decisions by the fundamental laws, rather than by those which are not fundamental"
judicial,"This exercise of judicial discretion, in determining between two contradictory laws, is exemplified in a familiar instance"
none,"It not uncommonly happens, that there are two statutes existing at one time, clashing in whole or in part with each other, and neither of them containing any repealing clause or expression"
judicial,"In such a case, it is the province of the courts to liquidate and fix their meaning and operation"
judicial,"So far as they can, by any fair construction, be reconciled to each other, reason and law conspire to dictate that this should be done"
none,"where this is impracticable, it becomes a matter of necessity to give effect to one, in exclusion of the other"
judicial,"The rule which has obtained in the courts for determining their relative validity is, that the last in order of time shall be preferred to the first"
judicial,"But this is a mere rule of construction, not derived from any positive law, but from the nature and reason of the thing"
judicial,"It is a rule not enjoined upon the courts by legislative provision, but adopted by themselves, as consonant to truth and propriety, for the direction of their conduct as interpreters of the law"
judicial,"They thought it reasonable, that between the interfering acts of an EQUAL authority, that which was the last indication of its will should have the preference"
checks and balances,"But in regard to the interfering acts of a superior and subordinate authority, of an original and derivative power, the nature and reason of the thing indicate the converse of that rule as proper to be followed"
none,They teach us that the prior act of a superior ought to be preferred to the subsequent act of an inferior and subordinate authority
judicial,"and that accordingly, whenever a particular statute contravenes the Constitution, it will be the duty of the judicial tribunals to adhere to the latter and disregard the former"
judicial,"It can be of no weight to say that the courts, on the pretense of a repugnancy, may substitute their own pleasure to the constitutional intentions of the legislature"
none,This might as well happen in the case of two contradictory statutes
none,or it might as well happen in every adjudication upon any single statute
judicial,The courts must declare the sense of the law
checks and balances,"and if they should be disposed to exercise WILL instead of JUDGMENT, the consequence would equally be the substitution of their pleasure to that of the legislative body"
judicial,"The observation, if it prove any thing, would prove that there ought to be no judges distinct from that body"
judicial,"If, then, the courts of justice are to be considered as the bulwarks of a limited Constitution against legislative encroachments, this consideration will afford a strong argument for the permanent tenure of judicial offices, since nothing will contribute so much as this to that independent spirit in the judges which must be essential to the faithful performance of so arduous a duty"
interest-group theory,"This independence of the judges is equally requisite to guard the Constitution and the rights of individuals from the effects of those ill humors, which the arts of designing men, or the influence of particular conjunctures, sometimes disseminate among the people themselves, and which, though they speedily give place to better information, and more deliberate reflection, have a tendency, in the meantime, to occasion dangerous innovations in the government, and serious oppressions of the minor party in the community"
republican principles,"Though I trust the friends of the proposed Constitution will never concur with its enemies,(3) in questioning that fundamental principle of republican government, which admits the right of the people to alter or abolish the established Constitution, whenever they find it inconsistent with their happiness, yet it is not to be inferred from this principle, that the representatives of the people, whenever a momentary inclination happens to lay hold of a majority of their constituents, incompatible with the provisions in the existing Constitution, would, on that account, be justifiable in a violation of those provisions"
judicial,"or that the courts would be under a greater obligation to connive at infractions in this shape, than when they had proceeded wholly from the cabals of the representative body"
nationalist outlook,"Until the people have, by some solemn and authoritative act, annulled or changed the established form, it is binding upon themselves collectively, as well as individually"
republican principles,"and no presumption, or even knowledge, of their sentiments, can warrant their representatives in a departure from it, prior to such an act"
judicial,"But it is easy to see, that it would require an uncommon portion of fortitude in the judges to do their duty as faithful guardians of the Constitution, where legislative invasions of it had been instigated by the major voice of the community"
judicial,"But it is not with a view to infractions of the Constitution only, that the independence of the judges may be an essential safeguard against the effects of occasional ill humors in the society"
natural rights,"These sometimes extend no farther than to the injury of the private rights of particular classes of citizens, by unjust and partial laws"
judicial,Here also the firmness of the judicial magistracy is of vast importance in mitigating the severity and confining the operation of such laws
checks and balances,"It not only serves to moderate the immediate mischiefs of those which may have been passed, but it operates as a check upon the legislative body in passing them"
judicial,"who, perceiving that obstacles to the success of iniquitous intention are to be expected from the scruples of the courts, are in a manner compelled, by the very motives of the injustice they meditate, to qualify their attempts"
none,"This is a circumstance calculated to have more influence upon the character of our governments, than but few may be aware of"
judicial,The benefits of the integrity and moderation of the judiciary have already been felt in more States than one
none,"and though they may have displeased those whose sinister expectations they may have disappointed, they must have commanded the esteem and applause of all the virtuous and disinterested"
judicial,"Considerate men, of every description, ought to prize whatever will tend to beget or fortify that temper in the courts"
none,"as no man can be sure that he may not be to-morrow the victim of a spirit of injustice, by which he may be a gainer to-day"
none,"And every man must now feel, that the inevitable tendency of such a spirit is to sap the foundations of public and private confidence, and to introduce in its stead universal distrust and distress"
judicial,"That inflexible and uniform adherence to the rights of the Constitution, and of individuals, which we perceive to be indispensable in the courts of justice, can certainly not be expected from judges who hold their offices by a temporary commission"
judicial,"Periodical appointments, however regulated, or by whomsoever made, would, in some way or other, be fatal to their necessary independence"
separation of powers,"If the power of making them was committed either to the Executive or legislature, there would be danger of an improper complaisance to the branch which possessed it"
none,"if to both, there would be an unwillingness to hazard the displeasure of either"
none,"if to the people, or to persons chosen by them for the special purpose, there would be too great a disposition to consult popularity, to justify a reliance that nothing would be consulted but the Constitution and the laws"
judicial,"There is yet a further and a weightier reason for the permanency of the judicial offices, which is deducible from the nature of the qualifications they require"
none,"It has been frequently remarked, with great propriety, that a voluminous code of laws is one of the inconveniences necessarily connected with the advantages of a free government"
judicial,"To avoid an arbitrary discretion in the courts, it is indispensable that they should be bound down by strict rules and precedents, which serve to define and point out their duty in every particular case that comes before them"
human nature,"and it will readily be conceived from the variety of controversies which grow out of the folly and wickedness of mankind, that the records of those precedents must unavoidably swell to a very considerable bulk, and must demand long and laborious study to acquire a competent knowledge of them"
judicial,"Hence it is, that there can be but few men in the society who will have sufficient skill in the laws to qualify them for the stations of judges"
human nature,"And making the proper deductions for the ordinary depravity of human nature, the number must be still smaller of those who unite the requisite integrity with the requisite knowledge"
none,"These considerations apprise us, that the government can have no great option between fit character"
judicial,"and that a temporary duration in office, which would naturally discourage such characters from quitting a lucrative line of practice to accept a seat on the bench, would have a tendency to throw the administration of justice into hands less able, and less well qualified, to conduct it with utility and dignity"
none,"In the present circumstances of this country, and in those in which it is likely to be for a long time to come, the disadvantages on this score would be greater than they may at first sight appear"
none,"but it must be confessed, that they are far inferior to those which present themselves under the other aspects of the subject"
judicial,"Upon the whole, there can be no room to doubt that the convention acted wisely in copying from the models of those constitutions which have established good behavior as the tenure of their judicial offices, in point of duration"

none,HAMILTON  To the People of the State of New York
none,THE residue of the argument against the provisions of the Constitution in respect to taxation is ingrafted upon the following clause
legislative,"The last clause of the eighth section of the first article of the plan under consideration authorizes the national legislature ""to make all laws which shall be NECESSARY and PROPER for carrying into execution THE POWERS by that Constitution vested in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof"""
strong federal government,"and the second clause of the sixth article declares, ""that the Constitution and the laws of the United States made IN PURSUANCE THEREOF, and the treaties made by their authority shall be the SUPREME LAW of the land, any thing in the constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding"

none,"and yet, strange as it may appear, after all this clamor, to those who may not have happened to contemplate them in the same light, it may be affirmed with perfect confidence that the constitutional operation of the intended government would be precisely the same, if these clauses were entirely obliterated, as if they were repeated in every article"
strong federal government,"They are only declaratory of a truth which would have resulted by necessary and unavoidable implication from the very act of constituting a federal government, and vesting it with certain specified powers"

legislative,"What are the proper means of executing such a power, but NECESSARY and PROPER laws"
none,This simple train of inquiry furnishes us at once with a test by which to judge of the true nature of the clause complained of
legislative,"It conducts us to this palpable truth, that a power to lay and collect taxes must be a power to pass all laws NECESSARY and PROPER for the execution of that power"
legislative,"and what does the unfortunate and calumniated provision in question do more than declare the same truth, to wit, that the national legislature, to whom the power of laying and collecting taxes had been previously given, might, in the execution of that power, pass all laws NECESSARY and PROPER to carry it into effect"
none,"I have applied these observations thus particularly to the power of taxation, because it is the immediate subject under consideration, and because it is the most important of the authorities proposed to be conferred upon the Union"
none,"But the same process will lead to the same result, in relation to all other powers declared in the Constitution"

union,"The Convention probably foresaw, what it has been a principal aim of these papers to inculcate, that the danger which most threatens our political welfare is that the State governments will finally sap the foundations of the Union"
none,"and might therefore think it necessary, in so cardinal a point, to leave nothing to construction"
none,"Whatever may have been the inducement to it, the wisdom of the precaution is evident from the cry which has been raised against it"
none,as that very cry betrays a disposition to question the great and essential truth which it is manifestly the object of that provision to declare
checks and balances,"But it may be again asked, Who is to judge of the NECESSITY and PROPRIETY of the laws to be passed for executing the powers of the Union"
none,"I answer, first, that this question arises as well and as fully upon the simple grant of those powers as upon the declaratory clause"

none,"As far as an improper accumulation of taxes on the same object might tend to render the collection difficult or precarious, this would be a mutual inconvenience, not arising from a superiority or defect of power on either side, but from an injudicious exercise of power by one or the other, in a manner equally disadvantageous to both"
union,"It is to be hoped and presumed, however, that mutual interest would dictate a concert in this respect which would avoid any material inconvenience"

interest-group theory,"As to those partial commotions and insurrections, which sometimes disquiet society, from the intrigues of an inconsiderable faction, or from sudden or occasional illhumors that do not infect the great body of the community the general government could command more extensive resources for the suppression of disturbances of that kind than would be in the power of any single member"
none,"And as to those mortal feuds which, in certain conjunctures, spread a conflagration through a whole nation, or through a very large proportion of it, proceeding either from weighty causes of discontent given by the government or from the contagion of some violent popular paroxysm, they do not fall within any ordinary rules of calculation"
none,"When they happen, they commonly amount to revolutions and dismemberments of empire"
none,No form of government can always either avoid or control them

natural rights,"Wednesday, May 28, 1788   HAMILTON  To the People of the State of New York"
none,"THE objection to the plan of the convention, which has met with most success in this State, and perhaps in several of the other States, is that relative to the want of a constitutional provision for the trial by jury in civil cases"
none,"The disingenuous form in which this objection is usually stated has been repeatedly adverted to and exposed, but continues to be pursued in all the conversations and writings of the opponents of the plan"
none,"The mere silence of the Constitution in regard to civil causes, is represented as an abolition of the trial by jury, and the declamations to which it has afforded a pretext are artfully calculated to induce a persuasion that this pretended abolition is complete and universal, extending not only to every species of civil, but even to criminal causes"
none,"To argue with respect to the latter would, however, be as vain and fruitless as to attempt the serious proof of the existence of matter, or to demonstrate any of those propositions which, by their own internal evidence, force conviction, when expressed in language adapted to convey their meaning"
none,"With regard to civil causes, subtleties almost too contemptible for refutation have been employed to countenance the surmise that a thing which is only not provided for, is entirely abolished"
none,Every man of discernment must at once perceive the wide difference between silence and abolition
none,"But as the inventors of this fallacy have attempted to support it by certain legal maxims of interpretation, which they have perverted from their true meaning, it may not be wholly useless to explore the ground they have taken"
none,The maxims on which they rely are of this nature
none,"""A specification of particulars is an exclusion of generals"""
none,"or, ""The expression of one thing is the exclusion of another"
natural rights,""" Hence, say they, as the Constitution has established the trial by jury in criminal cases, and is silent in respect to civil, this silence is an implied prohibition of trial by jury in regard to the latter"
judicial,"The rules of legal interpretation are rules of common sense, adopted by the courts in the construction of the laws"
none,"The true test, therefore, of a just application of them is its conformity to the source from which they are derived"
legislative,"This being the case, let me ask if it is consistent with common-sense to suppose that a provision obliging the legislative power to commit the trial of criminal causes to juries, is a privation of its right to authorize or permit that mode of trial in other cases"
none,"Is it natural to suppose, that a command to do one thing is a prohibition to the doing of another, which there was a previous power to do, and which is not incompatible with the thing commanded to be done"
none,"If such a supposition would be unnatural and unreasonable, it cannot be rational to maintain that an injunction of the trial by jury in certain cases is an interdiction of it in others"
judicial,A power to constitute courts is a power to prescribe the mode of trial
legislative,"and consequently, if nothing was said in the Constitution on the subject of juries, the legislature would be at liberty either to adopt that institution or to let it alone"
none,"This discretion, in regard to criminal causes, is abridged by the express injunction of trial by jury in all such cases"
none,"but it is, of course, left at large in relation to civil causes, there being a total silence on this head"
legislative,"The specification of an obligation to try all criminal causes in a particular mode, excludes indeed the obligation or necessity of employing the same mode in civil causes, but does not abridge the power of the legislature to exercise that mode if it should be thought proper"
legislative,"The pretense, therefore, that the national legislature would not be at full liberty to submit all the civil causes of federal cognizance to the determination of juries, is a pretense destitute of all just foundation"
none,From these observations this conclusion results
natural rights,that the trial by jury in civil cases would not be abolished
none,"and that the use attempted to be made of the maxims which have been quoted, is contrary to reason and common-sense, and therefore not admissible"
none,"Even if these maxims had a precise technical sense, corresponding with the idea of those who employ them upon the present occasion, which, however, is not the case, they would still be inapplicable to a constitution of government"
none,"In relation to such a subject, the natural and obvious sense of its provisions, apart from any technical rules, is the true criterion of construction"
none,"Having now seen that the maxims relied upon will not bear the use made of them, let us endeavor to ascertain their proper use and true meaning"
none,This will be best done by examples
legislative,"The plan of the convention declares that the power of Congress, or, in other words, of the national legislature, shall extend to certain enumerated cases"
legislative,"This specification of particulars evidently excludes all pretension to a general legislative authority, because an affirmative grant of special powers would be absurd, as well as useless, if a general authority was intended"
judicial,In like manner the judicial authority of the federal judicatures is declared by the Constitution to comprehend certain cases particularly specified
judicial,"The expression of those cases marks the precise limits, beyond which the federal courts cannot extend their jurisdiction, because the objects of their cognizance being enumerated, the specification would be nugatory if it did not exclude all ideas of more extensive authority"
none,"These examples are sufficient to elucidate the maxims which have been mentioned, and to designate the manner in which they should be used"
none,"But that there may be no misapprehensions upon this subject, I shall add one case more, to demonstrate the proper use of these maxims, and the abuse which has been made of them"
none,"Let us suppose that by the laws of this State a married woman was incapable of conveying her estate, and that the legislature, considering this as an evil, should enact that she might dispose of her property by deed executed in the presence of a magistrate"
none,"In such a case there can be no doubt but the specification would amount to an exclusion of any other mode of conveyance, because the woman having no previous power to alienate her property, the specification determines the particular mode which she is, for that purpose, to avail herself of"
none,"But let us further suppose that in a subsequent part of the same act it should be declared that no woman should dispose of any estate of a determinate value without the consent of three of her nearest relations, signified by their signing the deed"
none,could it be inferred from this regulation that a married woman might not procure the approbation of her relations to a deed for conveying property of inferior value
none,"The position is too absurd to merit a refutation, and yet this is precisely the position which those must establish who contend that the trial by juries in civil cases is abolished, because it is expressly provided for in cases of a criminal nature"
natural rights,"From these observations it must appear unquestionably true, that trial by jury is in no case abolished by the proposed Constitution, and it is equally true, that in those controversies between individuals in which the great body of the people are likely to be interested, that institution will remain precisely in the same situation in which it is placed by the State constitutions, and will be in no degree altered or influenced by the adoption of the plan under consideration"
judicial,"The foundation of this assertion is, that the national judiciary will have no cognizance of them, and of course they will remain determinable as heretofore by the State courts only, and in the manner which the State constitutions and laws prescribe"
federalism,"All land causes, except where claims under the grants of different States come into question, and all other controversies between the citizens of the same State, unless where they depend upon positive violations of the articles of union, by acts of the State legislatures, will belong exclusively to the jurisdiction of the State tribunals"
none,"Add to this, that admiralty causes, and almost all those which are of equity jurisdiction, are determinable under our own government without the intervention of a jury, and the inference from the whole will be, that this institution, as it exists with us at present, cannot possibly be affected to any great extent by the proposed alteration in our system of government"
natural rights,"The friends and adversaries of the plan of the convention, if they agree in nothing else, concur at least in the value they set upon the trial by jury"
none,or if there is any difference between them it consists in this
natural rights,the former regard it as a valuable safeguard to liberty
none,the latter represent it as the very palladium of free government
none,"For my own part, the more the operation of the institution has fallen under my observation, the more reason I have discovered for holding it in high estimation"
republican principles,"and it would be altogether superfluous to examine to what extent it deserves to be esteemed useful or essential in a representative republic, or how much more merit it may be entitled to, as a defense against the oppressions of an hereditary monarch, than as a barrier to the tyranny of popular magistrates in a popular government"
none,"Discussions of this kind would be more curious than beneficial, as all are satisfied of the utility of the institution, and of its friendly aspect to liberty"
natural rights,"But I must acknowledge that I cannot readily discern the inseparable connection between the existence of liberty, and the trial by jury in civil cases"
natural rights,"Arbitrary impeachments, arbitrary methods of prosecuting pretended offenses, and arbitrary punishments upon arbitrary convictions, have ever appeared to me to be the great engines of judicial despotism"
none,and these have all relation to criminal proceedings
natural rights,"The trial by jury in criminal cases, aided by the habeas corpus act, seems therefore to be alone concerned in the question"
none,"And both of these are provided for, in the most ample manner, in the plan of the convention"
natural rights,"It has been observed, that trial by jury is a safeguard against an oppressive exercise of the power of taxation"
none,This observation deserves to be canvassed
legislative,"It is evident that it can have no influence upon the legislature, in regard to the amount of taxes to be laid, to the objects upon which they are to be imposed, or to the rule by which they are to be apportioned"
legislative,"If it can have any influence, therefore, it must be upon the mode of collection, and the conduct of the officers intrusted with the execution of the revenue laws"
federalism,"As to the mode of collection in this State, under our own Constitution, the trial by jury is in most cases out of use"
none,"The taxes are usually levied by the more summary proceeding of distress and sale, as in cases of rent"
none,"And it is acknowledged on all hands, that this is essential to the efficacy of the revenue laws"
none,"The dilatory course of a trial at law to recover the taxes imposed on individuals, would neither suit the exigencies of the public nor promote the convenience of the citizens"
none,"It would often occasion an accumulation of costs, more burdensome than the original sum of the tax to be levied"
none,"And as to the conduct of the officers of the revenue, the provision in favor of trial by jury in criminal cases, will afford the security aimed at"
natural rights,"Wilful abuses of a public authority, to the oppression of the subject, and every species of official extortion, are offenses against the government, for which the persons who commit them may be indicted and punished according to the circumstances of the case"
natural rights,The excellence of the trial by jury in civil cases appears to depend on circumstances foreign to the preservation of liberty
none,"The strongest argument in its favor is, that it is a security against corruption"
human nature,"As there is always more time and better opportunity to tamper with a standing body of magistrates than with a jury summoned for the occasion, there is room to suppose that a corrupt influence would more easily find its way to the former than to the latter"
none,"The force of this consideration is, however, diminished by others"
human nature,"The sheriff, who is the summoner of ordinary juries, and the clerks of courts, who have the nomination of special juries, are themselves standing officers, and, acting individually, may be supposed more accessible to the touch of corruption than the judges, who are a collective body"
none,"It is not difficult to see, that it would be in the power of those officers to select jurors who would serve the purpose of the party as well as a corrupted bench"
none,"In the next place, it may fairly be supposed, that there would be less difficulty in gaining some of the jurors promiscuously taken from the public mass, than in gaining men who had been chosen by the government for their probity and good character"
none,"But making every deduction for these considerations, the trial by jury must still be a valuable check upon corruption"
none,It greatly multiplies the impediments to its success
none,"As matters now stand, it would be necessary to corrupt both court and jury"
none,"for where the jury have gone evidently wrong, the court will generally grant a new trial, and it would be in most cases of little use to practice upon the jury, unless the court could be likewise gained"
none,Here then is a double security
none,and it will readily be perceived that this complicated agency tends to preserve the purity of both institutions
none,"By increasing the obstacles to success, it discourages attempts to seduce the integrity of either"
none,"The temptations to prostitution which the judges might have to surmount, must certainly be much fewer, while the co-operation of a jury is necessary, than they might be, if they had themselves the exclusive determination of all causes"
natural rights,"Notwithstanding, therefore, the doubts I have expressed, as to the essentiality of trial by jury in civil cases to liberty, I admit that it is in most cases, under proper regulations, an excellent method of determining questions of property"
none,and that on this account alone it would be entitled to a constitutional provision in its favor if it were possible to fix the limits within which it ought to be comprehended
none,"There is, however, in all cases, great difficulty in this"
none,"and men not blinded by enthusiasm must be sensible that in a federal government, which is a composition of societies whose ideas and institutions in relation to the matter materially vary from each other, that difficulty must be not a little augmented"
none,"For my own part, at every new view I take of the subject, I become more convinced of the reality of the obstacles which, we are authoritatively informed, prevented the insertion of a provision on this head in the plan of the convention"
none,The great difference between the limits of the jury trial in different States is not generally understood
none,"and as it must have considerable influence on the sentence we ought to pass upon the omission complained of in regard to this point, an explanation of it is necessary"
none,"In this State, our judicial establishments resemble, more nearly than in any other, those of Great Britain"
none,"We have courts of common law, courts of probates (analogous in certain matters to the spiritual courts in England), a court of admiralty and a court of chancery"
natural rights,"In the courts of common law only, the trial by jury prevails, and this with some exceptions"
none,"In all the others a single judge presides, and proceeds in general either according to the course of the canon or civil law, without the aid of a jury"
none,"(1) In New Jersey, there is a court of chancery which proceeds like ours, but neither courts of admiralty nor of probates, in the sense in which these last are established with us"
natural rights,"In that State the courts of common law have the cognizance of those causes which with us are determinable in the courts of admiralty and of probates, and of course the jury trial is more extensive in New Jersey than in New York"
none,"In Pennsylvania, this is perhaps still more the case, for there is no court of chancery in that State, and its common-law courts have equity jurisdiction"
none,"It has a court of admiralty, but none of probates, at least on the plan of ours"
none,Delaware has in these respects imitated Pennsylvania
none,"Maryland approaches more nearly to New York, as does also Virginia, except that the latter has a plurality of chancellors"
none,North Carolina bears most affinity to Pennsylvania
none,South Carolina to Virginia
none,"I believe, however, that in some of those States which have distinct courts of admiralty, the causes depending in them are triable by juries"
none,"In Georgia there are none but common-law courts, and an appeal of course lies from the verdict of one jury to another, which is called a special jury, and for which a particular mode of appointment is marked out"
none,"In Connecticut, they have no distinct courts either of chancery or of admiralty, and their courts of probates have no jurisdiction of causes"
none,"Their common-law courts have admiralty and, to a certain extent, equity jurisdiction"
none,"In cases of importance, their General Assembly is the only court of chancery"
natural rights,"In Connecticut, therefore, the trial by jury extends in practice further than in any other State yet mentioned"
none,"Rhode Island is, I believe, in this particular, pretty much in the situation of Connecticut"
none,"Massachusetts and New Hampshire, in regard to the blending of law, equity, and admiralty jurisdictions, are in a similar predicament"
natural rights,"In the four Eastern States, the trial by jury not only stands upon a broader foundation than in the other States, but it is attended with a peculiarity unknown, in its full extent, to any of them"
none,"There is an appeal of course from one jury to another, till there have been two verdicts out of three on one side"
none,"From this sketch it appears that there is a material diversity, as well in the modification as in the extent of the institution of trial by jury in civil cases, in the several States"
none,and from this fact these obvious reflections flow
none,"first, that no general rule could have been fixed upon by the convention which would have corresponded with the circumstances of all the States"
none,"and secondly, that more or at least as much might have been hazarded by taking the system of any one State for a standard, as by omitting a provision altogether and leaving the matter, as has been done, to legislative regulation"
none,The propositions which have been made for supplying the omission have rather served to illustrate than to obviate the difficulty of the thing
none,"The minority of Pennsylvania have proposed this mode of expression for the purpose--""Trial by jury shall be as heretofore""--and this I maintain would be senseless and nugatory"
union,"The United States, in their united or collective capacity, are the OBJECT to which all general provisions in the Constitution must necessarily be construed to refer"
weakness of articles of Confederation,"Now it is evident that though trial by jury, with various limitations, is known in each State individually, yet in the United States, as such, it is at this time altogether unknown, because the present federal government has no judiciary power whatever"
weakness of articles of Confederation,and consequently there is no proper antecedent or previous establishment to which the term heretofore could relate
none,"It would therefore be destitute of a precise meaning, and inoperative from its uncertainty"
none,"As, on the one hand, the form of the provision would not fulfil the intent of its proposers, so, on the other, if I apprehend that intent rightly, it would be in itself inexpedient"
natural rights,"I presume it to be, that causes in the federal courts should be tried by jury, if, in the State where the courts sat, that mode of trial would obtain in a similar case in the State courts"
none,"that is to say, admiralty causes should be tried in Connecticut by a jury, in New York without one"
none,"The capricious operation of so dissimilar a method of trial in the same cases, under the same government, is of itself sufficient to indispose every wellregulated judgment towards it"
none,"Whether the cause should be tried with or without a jury, would depend, in a great number of cases, on the accidental situation of the court and parties"
none,"But this is not, in my estimation, the greatest objection"
none,I feel a deep and deliberate conviction that there are many cases in which the trial by jury is an ineligible one
judicial,"I think it so particularly in cases which concern the public peace with foreign nations--that is, in most cases where the question turns wholly on the laws of nations"
none,"Of this nature, among others, are all prize causes"
judicial,Juries cannot be supposed competent to investigations that require a thorough knowledge of the laws and usages of nations
none,and they will sometimes be under the influence of impressions which will not suffer them to pay sufficient regard to those considerations of public policy which ought to guide their inquiries
none,"There would of course be always danger that the rights of other nations might be infringed by their decisions, so as to afford occasions of reprisal and war"
none,"Though the proper province of juries be to determine matters of fact, yet in most cases legal consequences are complicated with fact in such a manner as to render a separation impracticable"
none,"It will add great weight to this remark, in relation to prize causes, to mention that the method of determining them has been thought worthy of particular regulation in various treaties between different powers of Europe, and that, pursuant to such treaties, they are determinable in Great Britain, in the last resort, before the king himself, in his privy council, where the fact, as well as the law, undergoes a re-examination"
none,"This alone demonstrates the impolicy of inserting a fundamental provision in the Constitution which would make the State systems a standard for the national government in the article under consideration, and the danger of encumbering the government with any constitutional provisions the propriety of which is not indisputable"
none,"My convictions are equally strong that great advantages result from the separation of the equity from the law jurisdiction, and that the causes which belong to the former would be improperly committed to juries"
judicial,"The great and primary use of a court of equity is to give relief in extraordinary cases, which are exceptions(2) to general rules"
none,"To unite the jurisdiction of such cases with the ordinary jurisdiction, must have a tendency to unsettle the general rules, and to subject every case that arises to a special determination"
none,"while a separation of the one from the other has the contrary effect of rendering one a sentinel over the other, and of keeping each within the expedient limits"
none,"Besides this, the circumstances that constitute cases proper for courts of equity are in many instances so nice and intricate, that they are incompatible with the genius of trials by jury"
none,"They require often such long, deliberate, and critical investigation as would be impracticable to men called from their occupations, and obliged to decide before they were permitted to return to them"
none,The simplicity and expedition which form the distinguishing characters of this mode of trial require that the matter to be decided should be reduced to some single and obvious point
none,while the litigations usual in chancery frequently comprehend a long train of minute and independent particulars
none,It is true that the separation of the equity from the legal jurisdiction is peculiar to the English system of jurisprudence
none,which is the model that has been followed in several of the States
none,But it is equally true that the trial by jury has been unknown in every case in which they have been united
none,And the separation is essential to the preservation of that institution in its pristine purity
judicial,The nature of a court of equity will readily permit the extension of its jurisdiction to matters of law
none,"but it is not a little to be suspected, that the attempt to extend the jurisdiction of the courts of law to matters of equity will not only be unproductive of the advantages which may be derived from courts of chancery, on the plan upon which they are established in this State, but will tend gradually to change the nature of the courts of law, and to undermine the trial by jury, by introducing questions too complicated for a decision in that mode"
none,"These appeared to be conclusive reasons against incorporating the systems of all the States, in the formation of the national judiciary, according to what may be conjectured to have been the attempt of the Pennsylvania minority"
none,Let us now examine how far the proposition of Massachusetts is calculated to remedy the supposed defect
none,It is in this form
natural rights,"""In civil actions between citizens of different States, every issue of fact, arising in actions at common law, may be tried by a jury if the parties, or either of them request it"
none,"""  This, at best, is a proposition confined to one description of causes"
none,"and the inference is fair, either that the Massachusetts convention considered that as the only class of federal causes, in which the trial by jury would be proper"
none,"or that if desirous of a more extensive provision, they found it impracticable to devise one which would properly answer the end"
none,"If the first, the omission of a regulation respecting so partial an object can never be considered as a material imperfection in the system"
none,"If the last, it affords a strong corroboration of the extreme difficulty of the thing"
none,But this is not all
none,"if we advert to the observations already made respecting the courts that subsist in the several States of the Union, and the different powers exercised by them, it will appear that there are no expressions more vague and indeterminate than those which have been employed to characterize that species of causes which it is intended shall be entitled to a trial by jury"
none,"In this State, the boundaries between actions at common law and actions of equitable jurisdiction, are ascertained in conformity to the rules which prevail in England upon that subject"
none,In many of the other States the boundaries are less precise
none,"In some of them every cause is to be tried in a court of common law, and upon that foundation every action may be considered as an action at common law, to be determined by a jury, if the parties, or either of them, choose it"
none,"Hence the same irregularity and confusion would be introduced by a compliance with this proposition, that I have already noticed as resulting from the regulation proposed by the Pennsylvania minority"
none,"In one State a cause would receive its determination from a jury, if the parties, or either of them, requested it"
none,"but in another State, a cause exactly similar to the other, must be decided without the intervention of a jury, because the State judicatories varied as to common-law jurisdiction"
union,"It is obvious, therefore, that the Massachusetts proposition, upon this subject cannot operate as a general regulation, until some uniform plan, with respect to the limits of common-law and equitable jurisdictions, shall be adopted by the different States"
none,"To devise a plan of that kind is a task arduous in itself, and which it would require much time and reflection to mature"
union,"It would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to suggest any general regulation that would be acceptable to all the States in the Union, or that would perfectly quadrate with the several State institutions"
none,"It may be asked, Why could not a reference have been made to the constitution of this State, taking that, which is allowed by me to be a good one, as a standard for the United States"
none,I answer that it is not very probable the other States would entertain the same opinion of our institutions as we do ourselves
none,"It is natural to suppose that they are hitherto more attached to their own, and that each would struggle for the preference"
none,"If the plan of taking one State as a model for the whole had been thought of in the convention, it is to be presumed that the adoption of it in that body would have been rendered difficult by the predilection of each representation in favor of its own government"
none,and it must be uncertain which of the States would have been taken as the model
none,It has been shown that many of them would be improper ones
none,"And I leave it to conjecture, whether, under all circumstances, it is most likely that New York, or some other State, would have been preferred"
none,"But admit that a judicious selection could have been effected in the convention, still there would have been great danger of jealousy and disgust in the other States, at the partiality which had been shown to the institutions of one"
none,"The enemies of the plan would have been furnished with a fine pretext for raising a host of local prejudices against it, which perhaps might have hazarded, in no inconsiderable degree, its final establishment"
none,"To avoid the embarrassments of a definition of the cases which the trial by jury ought to embrace, it is sometimes suggested by men of enthusiastic tempers, that a provision might have been inserted for establishing it in all cases whatsoever"
union,"For this I believe, no precedent is to be found in any member of the Union"
none,"and the considerations which have been stated in discussing the proposition of the minority of Pennsylvania, must satisfy every sober mind that the establishment of the trial by jury in all cases would have been an unpardonable error in the plan"
none,"In short, the more it is considered the more arduous will appear the task of fashioning a provision in such a form as not to express too little to answer the purpose, or too much to be advisable"
strong federal government,or which might not have opened other sources of opposition to the great and essential object of introducing a firm national government
none,"I cannot but persuade myself, on the other hand, that the different lights in which the subject has been placed in the course of these observations, will go far towards removing in candid minds the apprehensions they may have entertained on the point"
natural rights,"They have tended to show that the security of liberty is materially concerned only in the trial by jury in criminal cases, which is provided for in the most ample manner in the plan of the convention"
none,"that even in far the greatest proportion of civil cases, and those in which the great body of the community is interested, that mode of trial will remain in its full force, as established in the State constitutions, untouched and unaffected by the plan of the convention"
none,that it is in no case abolished(3) by that plan
none,and that there are great if not insurmountable difficulties in the way of making any precise and proper provision for it in a Constitution for the United States
none,"The best judges of the matter will be the least anxious for a constitutional establishment of the trial by jury in civil cases, and will be the most ready to admit that the changes which are continually happening in the affairs of society may render a different mode of determining questions of property preferable in many cases in which that mode of trial now prevails"
none,"For my part, I acknowledge myself to be convinced that even in this State it might be advantageously extended to some cases to which it does not at present apply, and might as advantageously be abridged in others"
none,It is conceded by all reasonable men that it ought not to obtain in all cases
none,"The examples of innovations which contract its ancient limits, as well in these States as in Great Britain, afford a strong presumption that its former extent has been found inconvenient, and give room to suppose that future experience may discover the propriety and utility of other exceptions"
legislative,"I suspect it to be impossible in the nature of the thing to fix the salutary point at which the operation of the institution ought to stop, and this is with me a strong argument for leaving the matter to the discretion of the legislature"
none,"This is now clearly understood to be the case in Great Britain, and it is equally so in the State of Connecticut"
none,"and yet it may be safely affirmed that more numerous encroachments have been made upon the trial by jury in this State since the Revolution, though provided for by a positive article of our constitution, than has happened in the same time either in Connecticut or Great Britain"
none,"It may be added that these encroachments have generally originated with the men who endeavor to persuade the people they are the warmest defenders of popular liberty, but who have rarely suffered constitutional obstacles to arrest them in a favorite career"
none,The truth is that the general GENIUS of a government is all that can be substantially relied upon for permanent effects
none,"Particular provisions, though not altogether useless, have far less virtue and efficacy than are commonly ascribed to them"
none,"and the want of them will never be, with men of sound discernment, a decisive objection to any plan which exhibits the leading characters of a good government"
natural rights,"It certainly sounds not a little harsh and extraordinary to affirm that there is no security for liberty in a Constitution which expressly establishes the trial by jury in criminal cases, because it does not do it in civil also"
none,"while it is a notorious fact that Connecticut, which has been always regarded as the most popular State in the Union, can boast of no constitutional provision for either"

none,"The constitution of New York makes no other provision for LOCALITY of elections, than that the members of the Assembly shall be elected in the COUNTIES"
none,"those of the Senate, in the great districts into which the State is or may be divided"
none,"these at present are four in number, and comprehend each from two to six counties"
natural rights,"It may readily be perceived that it would not be more difficult to the legislature of New York to defeat the suffrages of the citizens of New York, by confining elections to particular places, than for the legislature of the United States to defeat the suffrages of the citizens of the Union, by the like expedient"
none,"Suppose, for instance, the city of Albany was to be appointed the sole place of election for the county and district of which it is a part, would not the inhabitants of that city speedily become the only electors of the members both of the Senate and Assembly for that county and district"
none,"Can we imagine that the electors who reside in the remote subdivisions of the counties of Albany, Saratoga, Cambridge, etc"
none,", or in any part of the county of Montgomery, would take the trouble to come to the city of Albany, to give their votes for members of the Assembly or Senate, sooner than they would repair to the city of New York, to participate in the choice of the members of the federal House of Representatives"
none,"The alarming indifference discoverable in the exercise of so invaluable a privilege under the existing laws, which afford every facility to it, furnishes a ready answer to this question"
none,"And, abstracted from any experience on the subject, we can be at no loss to determine, that when the place of election is at an INCONVENIENT DISTANCE from the elector, the effect upon his conduct will be the same whether that distance be twenty miles or twenty thousand miles"
federalism,"Hence it must appear, that objections to the particular modification of the federal power of regulating elections will, in substance, apply with equal force to the modification of the like power in the constitution of this State"
none,"and for this reason it will be impossible to acquit the one, and to condemn the other"
none,A similar comparison would lead to the same conclusion in respect to the constitutions of most of the other States
none,"If it should be said that defects in the State constitutions furnish no apology for those which are to be found in the plan proposed, I answer, that as the former have never been thought chargeable with inattention to the security of liberty, where the imputations thrown on the latter can be shown to be applicable to them also, the presumption is that they are rather the cavilling refinements of a predetermined opposition, than the well-founded inferences of a candid research after truth"
none,"To those who are disposed to consider, as innocent omissions in the State constitutions, what they regard as unpardonable blemishes in the plan of the convention, nothing can be said"
none,"or at most, they can only be asked to assign some substantial reason why the representatives of the people in a single State should be more impregnable to the lust of power, or other sinister motives, than the representatives of the people of the United States"
none,"If they cannot do this, they ought at least to prove to us that it is easier to subvert the liberties of three millions of people, with the advantage of local governments to head their opposition, than of two hundred thousand people who are destitute of that advantage"
interest-group theory,"And in relation to the point immediately under consideration, they ought to convince us that it is less probable that a predominant faction in a single State should, in order to maintain its superiority, incline to a preference of a particular class of electors, than that a similar spirit should take possession of the representatives of thirteen States, spread over a vast region, and in several respects distinguishable from each other by a diversity of local circumstances, prejudices, and interests"
none,"Hitherto my observations have only aimed at a vindication of the provision in question, on the ground of theoretic propriety, on that of the danger of placing the power elsewhere, and on that of the safety of placing it in the manner proposed"
none,"But there remains to be mentioned a positive advantage which will result from this disposition, and which could not as well have been obtained from any other"
legislative,I allude to the circumstance of uniformity in the time of elections for the federal House of Representatives
interest-group theory,"It is more than possible that this uniformity may be found by experience to be of great importance to the public welfare, both as a security against the perpetuation of the same spirit in the body, and as a cure for the diseases of faction"
none,"If each State may choose its own time of election, it is possible there may be at least as many different periods as there are months in the year"
none,"The times of election in the several States, as they are now established for local purposes, vary between extremes as wide as March and November"
none,The consequence of this diversity would be that there could never happen a total dissolution or renovation of the body at one time
none,"If an improper spirit of any kind should happen to prevail in it, that spirit would be apt to infuse itself into the new members, as they come forward in succession"
none,"The mass would be likely to remain nearly the same, assimilating constantly to itself its gradual accretions"
human nature,There is a contagion in example which few men have sufficient force of mind to resist
none,"I am inclined to think that treble the duration in office, with the condition of a total dissolution of the body at the same time, might be less formidable to liberty than one third of that duration subject to gradual and successive alterations"
legislative,"Uniformity in the time of elections seems not less requisite for executing the idea of a regular rotation in the Senate, and for conveniently assembling the legislature at a stated period in each year"
none,"It may be asked, Why, then, could not a time have been fixed in the Constitution"
none,"As the most zealous adversaries of the plan of the convention in this State are, in general, not less zealous admirers of the constitution of the State, the question may be retorted, and it may be asked, Why was not a time for the like purpose fixed in the constitution of this State"
legislative,No better answer can be given than that it was a matter which might safely be entrusted to legislative discretion
none,"and that if a time had been appointed, it might, upon experiment, have been found less convenient than some other time"
none,The same answer may be given to the question put on the other side
federalism,"And it may be added that the supposed danger of a gradual change being merely speculative, it would have been hardly advisable upon that speculation to establish, as a fundamental point, what would deprive several States of the convenience of having the elections for their own governments and for the national government at the same epochs"

separation of powers,"It will be attended to, that in the examination of these expedients, I confine myself to their aptitude for ENFORCING the Constitution, by keeping the several departments of power within their due bounds, without particularly considering them as provisions for ALTERING the Constitution itself"
none,"In the first view, appeals to the people at fixed periods appear to be nearly as ineligible as appeals on particular occasions as they emerge"
none,"If the periods be separated by short intervals, the measures to be reviewed and rectified will have been of recent date, and will be connected with all the circumstances which tend to vitiate and pervert the result of occasional revisions"
none,"If the periods be distant from each other, the same remark will be applicable to all recent measures"
none,"and in proportion as the remoteness of the others may favor a dispassionate review of them, this advantage is inseparable from inconveniences which seem to counterbalance it"
none,"In the first place, a distant prospect of public censure would be a very feeble restraint on power from those excesses to which it might be urged by the force of present motives"
interest-group theory,"Is it to be imagined that a legislative assembly, consisting of a hundred or two hundred members, eagerly bent on some favorite object, and breaking through the restraints of the Constitution in pursuit of it, would be arrested in their career, by considerations drawn from a censorial revision of their conduct at the future distance of ten, fifteen, or twenty years"
none,"In the next place, the abuses would often have completed their mischievous effects before the remedial provision would be applied"
none,"And in the last place, where this might not be the case, they would be of long standing, would have taken deep root, and would not easily be extirpated"
none,"The scheme of revising the constitution, in order to correct recent breaches of it, as well as for other purposes, has been actually tried in one of the States"
separation of powers,"One of the objects of the Council of Censors which met in Pennsylvania in 1783 and 1784, was, as we have seen, to inquire, ""whether the constitution had been violated, and whether the legislative and executive departments had encroached upon each other"
none,""" This important and novel experiment in politics merits, in several points of view, very particular attention"
none,"In some of them it may, perhaps, as a single experiment, made under circumstances somewhat peculiar, be thought to be not absolutely conclusive"
none,"But as applied to the case under consideration, it involves some facts, which I venture to remark, as a complete and satisfactory illustration of the reasoning which I have employed"
none,First
none,"It appears, from the names of the gentlemen who composed the council, that some, at least, of its most active members had also been active and leading characters in the parties which pre-existed in the State"
none,Second
none,"It appears that the same active and leading members of the council had been active and influential members of the legislative and executive branches, within the period to be reviewed"
none,and even patrons or opponents of the very measures to be thus brought to the test of the constitution
none,"Two of the members had been vice-presidents of the State, and several other members of the executive council, within the seven preceding years"
none,"One of them had been speaker, and a number of others distinguished members, of the legislative assembly within the same period"
none,Third
none,Every page of their proceedings witnesses the effect of all these circumstances on the temper of their deliberations
interest-group theory,"Throughout the continuance of the council, it was split into two fixed and violent parties"
none,The fact is acknowledged and lamented by themselves
none,"Had this not been the case, the face of their proceedings exhibits a proof equally satisfactory"
none,"In all questions, however unimportant in themselves, or unconnected with each other, the same names stand invariably contrasted on the opposite columns"
human nature,"Every unbiased observer may infer, without danger of mistake, and at the same time without meaning to reflect on either party, or any individuals of either party, that, unfortunately, PASSION, not REASON, must have presided over their decisions"
human nature,"When men exercise their reason coolly and freely on a variety of distinct questions, they inevitably fall into different opinions on some of them"
human nature,"When they are governed by a common passion, their opinions, if they are so to be called, will be the same"
none,Fourth
separation of powers,"It is at least problematical, whether the decisions of this body do not, in several instances, misconstrue the limits prescribed for the legislative and executive departments, instead of reducing and limiting them within their constitutional places"
none,Fifth
none,"I have never understood that the decisions of the council on constitutional questions, whether rightly or erroneously formed, have had any effect in varying the practice founded on legislative constructions"
none,"It even appears, if I mistake not, that in one instance the contemporary legislature denied the constructions of the council, and actually prevailed in the contest"
none,"This censorial body, therefore, proves at the same time, by its researches, the existence of the disease, and by its example, the inefficacy of the remedy"
interest-group theory,"This conclusion cannot be invalidated by alleging that the State in which the experiment was made was at that crisis, and had been for a long time before, violently heated and distracted by the rage of party"
interest-group theory,"Is it to be presumed, that at any future septennial epoch the same State will be free from parties"
none,"Is it to be presumed that any other State, at the same or any other given period, will be exempt from them"
none,Such an event ought to be neither presumed nor desired
interest-group theory,"because an extinction of parties necessarily implies either a universal alarm for the public safety, or an absolute extinction of liberty"
none,"Were the precaution taken of excluding from the assemblies elected by the people, to revise the preceding administration of the government, all persons who should have been concerned with the government within the given period, the difficulties would not be obviated"
none,"The important task would probably devolve on men, who, with inferior capacities, would in other respects be little better qualified"

union,"THE importance of the Union, in a commercial light, is one of those points about which there is least room to entertain a difference of opinion, and which has, in fact, commanded the most general assent of men who have any acquaintance with the subject"
none,This applies as well to our intercourse with foreign countries as with each other
none,"There are appearances to authorize a supposition that the adventurous spirit, which distinguishes the commercial character of America, has already excited uneasy sensations in several of the maritime powers of Europe"
none,"They seem to be apprehensive of our too great interference in that carrying trade, which is the support of their navigation and the foundation of their naval strength"
none,"Those of them which have colonies in America look forward to what this country is capable of becoming, with painful solicitude"
none,"They foresee the dangers that may threaten their American dominions from the neighborhood of States, which have all the dispositions, and would possess all the means, requisite to the creation of a powerful marine"
none,"Impressions of this kind will naturally indicate the policy of fostering divisions among us, and of depriving us, as far as possible, of an ACTIVE COMMERCE in our own bottoms"
none,"This would answer the threefold purpose of preventing our interference in their navigation, of monopolizing the profits of our trade, and of clipping the wings by which we might soar to a dangerous greatness"
none,"Did not prudence forbid the detail, it would not be difficult to trace, by facts, the workings of this policy to the cabinets of ministers"
union,"If we continue united, we may counteract a policy so unfriendly to our prosperity in a variety of ways"
union,"By prohibitory regulations, extending, at the same time, throughout the States, we may oblige foreign countries to bid against each other, for the privileges of our markets"
none,"This assertion will not appear chimerical to those who are able to appreciate the importance of the markets of three millions of people--increasing in rapid progression, for the most part exclusively addicted to agriculture, and likely from local circumstances to remain so--to any manufacturing nation"
none,"and the immense difference there would be to the trade and navigation of such a nation, between a direct communication in its own ships, and an indirect conveyance of its products and returns, to and from America, in the ships of another country"
strong federal government,"Suppose, for instance, we had a government in America, capable of excluding Great Britain (with whom we have at present no treaty of commerce) from all our ports"
none,what would be the probable operation of this step upon her politics
none,"Would it not enable us to negotiate, with the fairest prospect of success, for commercial privileges of the most valuable and extensive kind, in the dominions of that kingdom"
none,"When these questions have been asked, upon other occasions, they have received a plausible, but not a solid or satisfactory answer"
none,"It has been said that prohibitions on our part would produce no change in the system of Britain, because she could prosecute her trade with us through the medium of the Dutch, who would be her immediate customers and paymasters for those articles which were wanted for the supply of our markets"
none,But would not her navigation be materially injured by the loss of the important advantage of being her own carrier in that trade
none,"Would not the principal part of its profits be intercepted by the Dutch, as a compensation for their agency and risk"
none,Would not the mere circumstance of freight occasion a considerable deduction
none,"Would not so circuitous an intercourse facilitate the competitions of other nations, by enhancing the price of British commodities in our markets, and by transferring to other hands the management of this interesting branch of the British commerce"
none,"A mature consideration of the objects suggested by these questions will justify a belief that the real disadvantages to Britain from such a state of things, conspiring with the pre-possessions of a great part of the nation in favor of the American trade, and with the importunities of the West India islands, would produce a relaxation in her present system, and would let us into the enjoyment of privileges in the markets of those islands elsewhere, from which our trade would derive the most substantial benefits"
none,"Such a point gained from the British government, and which could not be expected without an equivalent in exemptions and immunities in our markets, would be likely to have a correspondent effect on the conduct of other nations, who would not be inclined to see themselves altogether supplanted in our trade"
strong federal government,"A further resource for influencing the conduct of European nations toward us, in this respect, would arise from the establishment of a federal navy"
strong federal government,"There can be no doubt that the continuance of the Union under an efficient government would put it in our power, at a period not very distant, to create a navy which, if it could not vie with those of the great maritime powers, would at least be of respectable weight if thrown into the scale of either of two contending parties"
none,This would be more peculiarly the case in relation to operations in the West Indies
none,"A few ships of the line, sent opportunely to the reinforcement of either side, would often be sufficient to decide the fate of a campaign, on the event of which interests of the greatest magnitude were suspended"
strong federal government,"Our position is, in this respect, a most commanding one"
none,"And if to this consideration we add that of the usefulness of supplies from this country, in the prosecution of military operations in the West Indies, it will readily be perceived that a situation so favorable would enable us to bargain with great advantage for commercial privileges"
none,"A price would be set not only upon our friendship, but upon our neutrality"
union,"By a steady adherence to the Union we may hope, erelong, to become the arbiter of Europe in America, and to be able to incline the balance of European competitions in this part of the world as our interest may dictate"
none,"But in the reverse of this eligible situation, we shall discover that the rivalships of the parts would make them checks upon each other, and would frustrate all the tempting advantages which nature has kindly placed within our reach"
none,In a state so insignificant our commerce would be a prey to the wanton intermeddlings of all nations at war with each other

nationalist outlook,"A nation, despicable by its weakness, forfeits even the privilege of being neutral"
strong federal government,"Under a vigorous national government, the natural strength and resources of the country, directed to a common interest, would baffle all the combinations of European jealousy to restrain our growth"
none,"This situation would even take away the motive to such combinations, by inducing an impracticability of success"
strong federal government,"An active commerce, an extensive navigation, and a flourishing marine would then be the offspring of moral and physical necessity"
none,We might defy the little arts of the little politicians to control or vary the irresistible and unchangeable course of nature
none,"But in a state of disunion, these combinations might exist and might operate with success"
none,"It would be in the power of the maritime nations, availing themselves of our universal impotence, to prescribe the conditions of our political existence"
none,"and as they have a common interest in being our carriers, and still more in preventing our becoming theirs, they would in all probability combine to embarrass our navigation in such a manner as would in effect destroy it, and confine us to a PASSIVE COMMERCE"
none,"We should then be compelled to content ourselves with the first price of our commodities, and to see the profits of our trade snatched from us to enrich our enemies and persecutors"
none,"That unequaled spirit of enterprise, which signalizes the genius of the American merchants and navigators, and which is in itself an inexhaustible mine of national wealth, would be stifled and lost, and poverty and disgrace would overspread a country which, with wisdom, might make herself the admiration and envy of the world"
nationalist outlook,"There are rights of great moment to the trade of America which are rights of the Union--I allude to the fisheries, to the navigation of the Western lakes, and to that of the Mississippi"
weakness of articles of Confederation,The dissolution of the Confederacy would give room for delicate questions concerning the future existence of these rights
none,which the interest of more powerful partners would hardly fail to solve to our disadvantage
none,The disposition of Spain with regard to the Mississippi needs no comment

none,"They, of course, would hardly remain long indifferent to that decided mastery, of which experience has shown us to be possessed in this valuable branch of traffic, and by which we are able to undersell those nations in their own markets"
none,What more natural than that they should be disposed to exclude from the lists such dangerous competitors

union,"A navy of the United States, as it would embrace the resources of all, is an object far less remote than a navy of any single State or partial confederacy, which would only embrace the resources of a single part"
none,"It happens, indeed, that different portions of confederated America possess each some peculiar advantage for this essential establishment"
none,"The more southern States furnish in greater abundance certain kinds of naval stores--tar, pitch, and turpentine"
none,Their wood for the construction of ships is also of a more solid and lasting texture
none,"The difference in the duration of the ships of which the navy might be composed, if chiefly constructed of Southern wood, would be of signal importance, either in the view of naval strength or of national economy"
none,"Some of the Southern and of the Middle States yield a greater plenty of iron, and of better quality"
none,Seamen must chiefly be drawn from the Northern hive
none,"The necessity of naval protection to external or maritime commerce does not require a particular elucidation, no more than the conduciveness of that species of commerce to the prosperity of a navy"
union,"An unrestrained intercourse between the States themselves will advance the trade of each by an interchange of their respective productions, not only for the supply of reciprocal wants at home, but for exportation to foreign markets"
none,"The veins of commerce in every part will be replenished, and will acquire additional motion and vigor from a free circulation of the commodities of every part"
union,"Commercial enterprise will have much greater scope, from the diversity in the productions of different States"
union,"When the staple of one fails from a bad harvest or unproductive crop, it can call to its aid the staple of another"

union,It can be conducted upon much better terms with a large number of materials of a given value than with a small number of materials of the same value
none,arising from the competitions of trade and from the fluctuations of markets
none,"Particular articles may be in great demand at certain periods, and unsalable at others"
none,"but if there be a variety of articles, it can scarcely happen that they should all be at one time in the latter predicament, and on this account the operations of the merchant would be less liable to any considerable obstruction or stagnation"
union,"The speculative trader will at once perceive the force of these observations, and will acknowledge that the aggregate balance of the commerce of the United States would bid fair to be much more favorable than that of the thirteen States without union or with partial unions"
union,"It may perhaps be replied to this, that whether the States are united or disunited, there would still be an intimate intercourse between them which would answer the same ends"
none,"this intercourse would be fettered, interrupted, and narrowed by a multiplicity of causes, which in the course of these papers have been amply detailed"
union,"A unity of commercial, as well as political, interests, can only result from a unity of government"
none,"There are other points of view in which this subject might be placed, of a striking and animating kind"
none,"But they would lead us too far into the regions of futurity, and would involve topics not proper for a newspaper discussion"
none,"I shall briefly observe, that our situation invites and our interests prompt us to aim at an ascendant in the system of American affairs"
none,"The world may politically, as well as geographically, be divided into four parts, each having a distinct set of interests"
none,"Unhappily for the other three, Europe, by her arms and by her negotiations, by force and by fraud, has, in different degrees, extended her dominion over them all"
none,"Africa, Asia, and America, have successively felt her domination"
none,"The superiority she has long maintained has tempted her to plume herself as the Mistress of the World, and to consider the rest of mankind as created for her benefit"

none,"but in this particular act they are to be thrown into the form of individual delegations, from so many distinct and coequal bodies politic"
none,"From this aspect of the government it appears to be of a mixed character, presenting at least as many FEDERAL as NATIONAL features"
none,"The difference between a federal and national government, as it relates to the OPERATION OF THE GOVERNMENT, is supposed to consist in this, that in the former the powers operate on the political bodies composing the Confederacy, in their political capacities"

none,But this blemish is perhaps unavoidable in any plan
none,"and the operation of the government on the people, in their individual capacities, in its ordinary and most essential proceedings, may, on the whole, designate it, in this relation, a NATIONAL government"
none,"But if the government be national with regard to the OPERATION of its powers, it changes its aspect again when we contemplate it in relation to the EXTENT of its powers"
strong federal government,"The idea of a national government involves in it, not only an authority over the individual citizens, but an indefinite supremacy over all persons and things, so far as they are objects of lawful government"
nationalist outlook,"Among a people consolidated into one nation, this supremacy is completely vested in the national legislature"
none,"Among communities united for particular purposes, it is vested partly in the general and partly in the municipal legislatures"
none,"In the former case, all local authorities are subordinate to the supreme"
none,"and may be controlled, directed, or abolished by it at pleasure"
none,"In the latter, the local or municipal authorities form distinct and independent portions of the supremacy, no more subject, within their respective spheres, to the general authority, than the general authority is subject to them, within its own sphere"
none,"In this relation, then, the proposed government cannot be deemed a NATIONAL one"
none,"since its jurisdiction extends to certain enumerated objects only, and leaves to the several States a residuary and inviolable sovereignty over all other objects"
none,"It is true that in controversies relating to the boundary between the two jurisdictions, the tribunal which is ultimately to decide, is to be established under the general government"
none,But this does not change the principle of the case

none,and all the usual and most effectual precautions are taken to secure this impartiality
none,Some such tribunal is clearly essential to prevent an appeal to the sword and a dissolution of the compact
none,"and that it ought to be established under the general rather than under the local governments, or, to speak more properly, that it could be safely established under the first alone, is a position not likely to be combated"
none,"If we try the Constitution by its last relation to the authority by which amendments are to be made, we find it neither wholly NATIONAL nor wholly FEDERAL"
none,"Were it wholly national, the supreme and ultimate authority would reside in the MAJORITY of the people of the Union"
none,"and this authority would be competent at all times, like that of a majority of every national society, to alter or abolish its established government"
none,"Were it wholly federal, on the other hand, the concurrence of each State in the Union would be essential to every alteration that would be binding on all"
none,The mode provided by the plan of the convention is not founded on either of these principles

federalism,"In requiring more than a majority, and particularly in computing the proportion by STATES, not by CITIZENS, it departs from the NATIONAL and advances towards the FEDERAL character"

legislative,"as the legislative department alone has access to the pockets of the people, and has in some constitutions full discretion, and in all a prevailing influence, over the pecuniary rewards of those who fill the other departments, a dependence is thus created in the latter, which gives still greater facility to encroachments of the former"

none,"We have seen how far such a supposition would err, as to the two first points"
none,"Nor would it, in fact, be less erroneous as to the last"
republican principles,"The only difference discoverable between the two cases is, that each representative of the United States will be elected by five or six thousand citizens"
republican principles,"whilst in the individual States, the election of a representative is left to about as many hundreds"
none,"Will it be pretended that this difference is sufficient to justify an attachment to the State governments, and an abhorrence to the federal government"
none,"If this be the point on which the objection turns, it deserves to be examined"
none,Is it supported by REASON
none,"This cannot be said, without maintaining that five or six thousand citizens are less capable of choosing a fit representative, or more liable to be corrupted by an unfit one, than five or six hundred"
republican principles,"Reason, on the contrary, assures us, that as in so great a number a fit representative would be most likely to be found, so the choice would be less likely to be diverted from him by the intrigues of the ambitious or the ambitious or the bribes of the rich"
none,Is the CONSEQUENCE from this doctrine admissible
none,"If we say that five or six hundred citizens are as many as can jointly exercise their right of suffrage, must we not deprive the people of the immediate choice of their public servants, in every instance where the administration of the government does not require as many of them as will amount to one for that number of citizens"
none,Is the doctrine warranted by FACTS
none,"It was shown in the last paper, that the real representation in the British House of Commons very little exceeds the proportion of one for every thirty thousand inhabitants"
none,"Besides a variety of powerful causes not existing here, and which favor in that country the pretensions of rank and wealth, no person is eligible as a representative of a county, unless he possess real estate of the clear value of six hundred pounds sterling per year"
none,"nor of a city or borough, unless he possess a like estate of half that annual value"
none,"To this qualification on the part of the county representatives is added another on the part of the county electors, which restrains the right of suffrage to persons having a freehold estate of the annual value of more than twenty pounds sterling, according to the present rate of money"
none,"Notwithstanding these unfavorable circumstances, and notwithstanding some very unequal laws in the British code, it cannot be said that the representatives of the nation have elevated the few on the ruins of the many"
none,But we need not resort to foreign experience on this subject
none,Our own is explicit and decisive
none,"The districts in New Hampshire in which the senators are chosen immediately by the people, are nearly as large as will be necessary for her representatives in the Congress"
none,Those of Massachusetts are larger than will be necessary for that purpose
none,and those of New York still more so
none,"In the last State the members of Assembly for the cities and counties of New York and Albany are elected by very nearly as many voters as will be entitled to a representative in the Congress, calculating on the number of sixty-five representatives only"
legislative,It makes no difference that in these senatorial districts and counties a number of representatives are voted for by each elector at the same time
none,"If the same electors at the same time are capable of choosing four or five representatives, they cannot be incapable of choosing one"
none,Pennsylvania is an additional example
none,"Some of her counties, which elect her State representatives, are almost as large as her districts will be by which her federal representatives will be elected"
none,The city of Philadelphia is supposed to contain between fifty and sixty thousand souls
none,It will therefore form nearly two districts for the choice of federal representatives
none,"It forms, however, but one county, in which every elector votes for each of its representatives in the State legislature"
none,"And what may appear to be still more directly to our purpose, the whole city actually elects a SINGLE MEMBER for the executive council"
none,This is the case in all the other counties of the State
none,Are not these facts the most satisfactory proofs of the fallacy which has been employed against the branch of the federal government under consideration
none,"Has it appeared on trial that the senators of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and New York, or the executive council of Pennsylvania, or the members of the Assembly in the two last States, have betrayed any peculiar disposition to sacrifice the many to the few, or are in any respect less worthy of their places than the representatives and magistrates appointed in other States by very small divisions of the people"
none,But there are cases of a stronger complexion than any which I have yet quoted
none,One branch of the legislature of Connecticut is so constituted that each member of it is elected by the whole State
none,"So is the governor of that State, of Massachusetts, and of this State, and the president of New Hampshire"
republican principles,"I leave every man to decide whether the result of any one of these experiments can be said to countenance a suspicion, that a diffusive mode of choosing representatives of the people tends to elevate traitors and to undermine the public liberty"
none,PUBLIUS
